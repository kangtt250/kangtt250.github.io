Meaningless!” says the Teacher. “Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless.”<p>传道者说：“虚空的虚空，虚空的虚空，凡事都是虚空。”</blockquote><p>传1:3<blockquote><p>What does man gain from all his labor at which he toils under the sun?<p>人一切的劳碌，就是他在日光之下的劳碌，有什么益处呢？</blockquote><p>传1:4<blockquote><p>Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever.<p>一代过去，一代又来，地却永远长存。</blockquote><p>传1:5<blockquote><p>The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to where it rises.<p>日头出来，日头落下，急归所出之地。</blockquote><p>传1:6<blockquote><p>The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course.<p>风往南刮，又向北转，不住地旋转，而且返回转行原道。</blockquote><p>传1:7<blockquote><p>All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again.<p>江河都往海里流，海却不满；江河从何处流，仍归还何处。</blockquote><p>传1:8<blockquote><p>All things are wearisome, more than one can say. The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing.<p>万事令人厌烦（或作“万物满有困乏”），人不能说尽。眼看，看不饱；耳听，听不足。</blockquote><p>传1:9<blockquote><p>What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.<p>已有的事，后必再有；已行的事，后必再行。日光之下，并无新事。</blockquote><p>传1:10<blockquote><p>Is there anything of which one can say, “Look! This is something new”? It was here already, long ago; it was here before our time.<p>岂有一件事人能指着说：“这是新的”？哪知，在我们以前的世代早已有了。</blockquote><p>传1:11<blockquote><p>There is no remembrance of men of old, and even those who are yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow.<p>已过的世代，无人记念；将来的世代，后来的人也不记念。</blockquote><p>传1:12<blockquote><p>I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.<p>我传道者在耶路撒冷作过以色列的王。</blockquote><p>传1:13<blockquote><p>I devoted myself to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a heavy burden God has laid on men!<p>我专心用智慧寻求查究天下所做的一切事，乃知　神叫世人所经练的是极重的劳苦。</blockquote><p>传1:14<blockquote><p>I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.<p>我见日光之下所做的一切事，都是虚空，都是捕风。</blockquote><p>传1:15<blockquote><p>What is twisted cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted.<p>弯曲的不能变直；缺少的不能足数。</blockquote><p>传1:16<blockquote><p>I thought to myself, “Look, I have grown and increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge.”<p>我心里议论说：“我得了大智慧，胜过我以前在耶路撒冷的众人，而且我心中多经历智慧和知识的事。”</blockquote><p>传1:17<blockquote><p>Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.<p>我又专心察明智慧、狂妄和愚昧，乃知这也是捕风。</blockquote><p>传1:18<blockquote><p>For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief.<p>因为多有智慧，就多有愁烦；加增知识的，就加增忧伤。</blockquote><h2 id="传道书第2章">传道书第2章</h2><p>传2:1<blockquote><p>I thought in my heart, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good.” But that also proved to be meaningless.<p>我心里说：“来吧！我以喜乐试试你，你好享福。”谁知，这也是虚空。</blockquote><p>传2:2<blockquote><p>“Laughter,” I said, “is foolish. And what does pleasure accomplish?”<p>我指嬉笑说：“这是狂妄”；论喜乐说：“有何功效呢？”</blockquote><p>传2:3<blockquote><p>I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly–my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of their lives.<p>我心里察究，如何用酒使我肉体舒畅，我心却仍以智慧引导我；又如何持住愚昧，等我看明世人，在天下一生当行何事为美。</blockquote><p>传2:4<blockquote><p>I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards.<p>我为自己动大工程，建造房屋，栽种葡萄园；</blockquote><p>传2:5<blockquote><p>I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.<p>修造园囿，在其中栽种各样果木树；</blockquote><p>传2:6<blockquote><p>I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees.<p>挖造水池，用以浇灌嫩小的树木。</blockquote><p>传2:7<blockquote><p>I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me.<p>我买了仆婢，也有生在家中的仆婢；又有许多牛群羊群，胜过以前在耶路撒冷众人所有的。</blockquote><p>传2:8<blockquote><p>I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired men and women singers, and a harem as well–the delights of the heart of man.<p>我又为自己积蓄金银和君王的财宝，并各省的财宝；又得唱歌的男女和世人所喜爱的物，并许多的妃嫔。</blockquote><p>传2:9<blockquote><p>I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me.<p>这样，我就日见昌盛，胜过以前在耶路撒冷的众人。我的智慧仍然存留。</blockquote><p>传2:10<blockquote><p>I denied myself nothing my eyes desired; I refused my heart no pleasure. My heart took delight in all my work, and this was the reward for all my labor.<p>凡我眼所求的，我没有留下不给他的；我心所乐的，我没有禁止不享受的；因我的心为我一切所劳碌的快乐，这就是我从劳碌中所得的分。</blockquote><p>传2:11<blockquote><p>Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind; nothing was gained under the sun.<p>后来，我察看我手所经营的一切事和我劳碌所成的功，谁知都是虚空，都是捕风，在日光之下毫无益处。</blockquote><p>传2:12<blockquote><p>Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom, and also madness and folly. What more can the king’s successor do than what has already been done?<p>我转念观看智慧、狂妄和愚昧。在王以后而来的人还能做什么呢？也不过行早先所行的就是了。</blockquote><p>传2:13<blockquote><p>I saw that wisdom is better than folly, just as light is better than darkness.<p>我便看出智慧胜过愚昧，如同光明胜过黑暗。</blockquote><p>传2:14<blockquote><p>The wise man has eyes in his head, while the fool walks in the darkness; but I came to realize that the same fate overtakes them both.<p>智慧人的眼目光明（原文作“在他头上”）；愚昧人在黑暗里行。我却看明有一件事，这两等人都必遇见。</blockquote><p>传2:15<blockquote><p>Then I thought in my heart, “The fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise?” I said in my heart, “This too is meaningless.”<p>我就心里说：“愚昧人所遇见的，我也必遇见，我为何更有智慧呢？”我心里说：“这也是虚空。”</blockquote><p>传2:16<blockquote><p>For the wise man, like the fool, will not be long remembered; in days to come both will be forgotten. Like the fool, the wise man too must die!<p>智慧人和愚昧人一样，永远无人记念，因为日后都被忘记；可叹智慧人死亡，与愚昧人无异。</blockquote><p>传2:17<blockquote><p>So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.<p>我所以恨恶生命，因为在日光之下所行的事，我都以为烦恼，都是虚空，都是捕风。</blockquote><p>传2:18<blockquote><p>I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.<p>我恨恶一切的劳碌，就是我在日光之下的劳碌，因为我得来的必留给我以后的人。</blockquote><p>传2:19<blockquote><p>And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the work into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.<p>那人是智慧是愚昧，谁能知道？他竟要管理我劳碌所得的，就是我在日光之下用智慧所得的。这也是虚空。</blockquote><p>传2:20<blockquote><p>So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun.<p>故此，我转想我在日光之下所劳碌的一切工作，心便绝望。</blockquote><p>传2:21<blockquote><p>For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then he must leave all he owns to someone who has not worked for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.<p>因为有人用智慧、知识、灵巧所劳碌得来的，却要留给未曾劳碌的人为分。这也是虚空，也是大患！</blockquote><p>传2:22<blockquote><p>What does a man get for all the toil and anxious striving with which he labors under the sun?<p>人在日光之下劳碌累心，在他一切的劳碌上得着什么呢？</blockquote><p>传2:23<blockquote><p>All his days his work is pain and grief; even at night his mind does not rest. This too is meaningless.<p>因为他日日忧虑，他的劳苦成为愁烦，连夜间心也不安。这也是虚空。</blockquote><p>传2:24<blockquote><p>A man can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in his work. This too, I see, is from the hand of God,<p>人莫强如吃喝，且在劳碌中享福，我看这也是出于　神的手。</blockquote><p>传2:25<blockquote><p>for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?<p>论到吃用、享福，谁能胜过我呢？</blockquote><p>传2:26<blockquote><p>To the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.<p>神喜悦谁，就给谁智慧、知识和喜乐，惟有罪人，　神使他劳苦，叫他将所收聚的、所堆积的归给　神所喜悦的人。这也是虚空，也是捕风。</blockquote><h2 id="传道书第3章">传道书第3章</h2><p>传3:1<blockquote><p>There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under heaven:<p>凡事都有定期，天下万务都有定时。</blockquote><p>传3:2<blockquote><p>a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot,<p>生有时，死有时；栽种有时，拔出所栽种的也有时；</blockquote><p>传3:3<blockquote><p>a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build,<p>杀戮有时，医治有时；拆毁有时，建造有时；</blockquote><p>传3:4<blockquote><p>a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance,<p>哭有时，笑有时；哀恸有时，跳舞有时；</blockquote><p>传3:5<blockquote><p>a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain,<p>抛掷石头有时，堆聚石头有时；怀抱有时，不怀抱有时；</blockquote><p>传3:6<blockquote><p>a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away,<p>寻找有时，失落有时；保守有时，舍弃有时；</blockquote><p>传3:7<blockquote><p>a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak,<p>撕裂有时，缝补有时；静默有时，言语有时；</blockquote><p>传3:8<blockquote><p>a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace.<p>喜爱有时，恨恶有时；争战有时，和好有时。</blockquote><p>传3:9<blockquote><p>What does the worker gain from his toil?<p>这样看来，做事的人在他的劳碌上有什么益处呢？</blockquote><p>传3:10<blockquote><p>I have seen the burden God has laid on men.<p>我见　神叫世人劳苦，使他们在其中受经练。</blockquote><p>传3:11<blockquote><p>He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end.<p>神造万物，各按其时成为美好，又将永生安置在世人心里（“永生”原文作“永远”)。然而　神从始至终的作为，人不能参透。</blockquote><p>传3:12<blockquote><p>I know that there is nothing better for men than to be happy and do good while they live.<p>我知道世人，莫强如终身喜乐行善，</blockquote><p>传3:13<blockquote><p>That everyone may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all his toil–this is the gift of God.<p>并且人人吃喝，在他一切劳碌中享福，这也是　神的恩赐。</blockquote><p>传3:14<blockquote><p>I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that men will revere him.<p>我知道　神一切所做的都必永存，无所增添，无所减少。　神这样行，是要人在他面前存敬畏的心。</blockquote><p>传3:15<blockquote><p>Whatever is has already been, and what will be has been before; and God will call the past to account.<p>现今的事早先就有了，将来的事早已也有了，并且　神使已过的事重新再来（或作“并且　神再寻回已过的事”）。</blockquote><p>传3:16<blockquote><p>And I saw something else under the sun: In the place of judgment–wickedness was there, in the place of justice–wickedness was there.<p>我又见日光之下：在审判之处有奸恶，在公义之处也有奸恶。</blockquote><p>传3:17<blockquote><p>I thought in my heart, “God will bring to judgment both the righteous and the wicked, for there will be a time for every activity, a time for every deed.”<p>我心里说：“　神必审判义人和恶人，因为在那里，各样事务，一切工作，都有定时。”</blockquote><p>传3:18<blockquote><p>I also thought, “As for men, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals.<p>我心里说：“这乃为世人的缘故，是　神要试验他们，使他们觉得自己不过像兽一样。</blockquote><p>传3:19<blockquote><p>Man’s fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other.

For who can bring him to see what will happen after him?<p>故此，我见人莫强如在他经营的事上喜乐，因为这是他的分；他身后的事，谁能使他回来得见呢？</blockquote><h2 id="传道书第4章">传道书第4章</h2><p>传4:1<blockquote><p>Again I looked and saw all the oppression that was taking place under the sun: I saw the tears of the oppressed–and they have no comforter; power was on the side of their oppressors–and they have no comforter.<p>我又转念，见日光之下所行的一切欺压：看哪，受欺压的流泪，且无人安慰；欺压他们的有势力，也无人安慰他们。</blockquote><p>传4:2<blockquote><p>And I declared that the dead, who had already died, are happier than the living, who are still alive.<p>因此，我赞叹那早已死的死人，胜过那还活着的活人。</blockquote><p>传4:3<blockquote><p>But better than both is he who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun.<p>并且我以为那未曾生的，就是未见过日光之下恶事的，比这两等人更强。</blockquote><p>传4:4<blockquote><p>And I saw that all labor and all achievement spring from man’s envy of his neighbor.

No one knows what is coming–who can tell him what will happen after him?<p>愚昧人多有言语。人却不知将来有什么事；他身后的事，谁能告诉他呢？</blockquote><p>传10:15<blockquote><p>A fool’s work wearies him; he does not know the way to town.<p>凡愚昧人，他的劳碌使自己困乏，因为连进城的路，他也不知道。</blockquote><p>传10:16<blockquote><p>Woe to you, O land whose king was a servant and whose princes feast in the morning.<p>邦国啊，你的王若是孩童，你的群臣早晨宴乐，你就有祸了！</blockquote><p>传10:17<blockquote><p>Blessed are you, O land whose king is of noble birth and whose princes eat at a proper time–for strength and not for drunkenness.<p>邦国啊，你的王若是贵胄之子，你的群臣按时吃喝，为要补力，不为酒醉，你就有福了！</blockquote><p>传10:18<blockquote><p>If a man is lazy, the rafters sag; if his hands are idle, the house leaks.<p>因人懒惰，房顶塌下；因人手懒，房屋滴漏。</blockquote><p>传10:19<blockquote><p>A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes life merry, but money is the answer for everything.<p>设摆筵席，是为喜笑。酒能使人快活，钱能叫万事应心。</blockquote><p>传10:20<blockquote><p>Do not revile the king even in your thoughts, or curse the rich in your bedroom, because a bird of the air may carry your words, and a bird on the wing may report what you say.<p>你不可咒诅君王，也不可心怀此念，在你卧房也不可咒诅富户，因为空中的鸟必传扬这声音，有翅膀的也必述说这事。</blockquote><h2 id="传道书第11章">传道书第11章</h2><p>传11:1<blockquote><p>Cast your bread upon the waters, for after many days you will find it again.<p>当将你的粮食撒在水面，因为日久必能得着。</blockquote><p>传11:2<blockquote><p>Give portions to seven, yes to eight, for you do not know what disaster may come upon the land.<p>你要分给七人，或分给八人，因为你不知道将来有什么灾祸临到地上。</blockquote><p>传11:3<blockquote><p>If clouds are full of water, they pour rain upon the earth. Whether a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where it falls, there will it lie.<p>云若满了雨，就必倾倒在地上；树若向南倒，或向北倒，树倒在何处，就存在何处。</blockquote><p>传11:4<blockquote><p>Whoever watches the wind will not plant; whoever looks at the clouds will not reap.<p>看风的必不撒种；望云的必不收割。</blockquote><p>传11:5<blockquote><p>As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body is formed in a mother’s womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the Maker of all things.<p>风从何道来，骨头在怀孕妇人的胎中如何长成，你尚且不得知道，这样，行万事之神的作为，你更不得知道。</blockquote><p>传11:6<blockquote><p>Sow your seed in the morning, and at evening let not your hands be idle, for you do not know which will succeed, whether this or that, or whether both will do equally well.<p>早晨要撒你的种，晚上也不要歇你的手，因为你不知道哪一样发旺：或是早撒的，或是晚撒的，或是两样都好。</blockquote><p>传11:7<blockquote><p>Light is sweet, and it pleases the eyes to see the sun.<p>光本是佳美的，眼见日光也是可悦的。</blockquote><p>传11:8<blockquote><p>However many years a man may live, let him enjoy them all. But let him remember the days of darkness, for they will be many. Everything to come is meaningless.<p>人活多年，就当快乐多年；然而也当想到黑暗的日子。因为这日子必多，所要来的都是虚空。</blockquote><p>传11:9<blockquote><p>Be happy, young man, while you are young, and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth. Follow the ways of your heart and whatever your eyes see, but know that for all these things God will bring you to judgment.<p>少年人哪，你在幼年时当快乐。在幼年的日子，使你的心欢畅，行你心所愿行的，看你眼所爱看的；却要知道，为这一切的事，　神必审问你。</blockquote><p>传11:10<blockquote><p>So then, banish anxiety from your heart and cast off the troubles of your body, for youth and vigor are meaningless.<p>所以你当从心中除掉愁烦，从肉体克去邪恶，因为一生的开端和幼年之时，都是虚空的。</blockquote><h2 id="传道书第12章">传道书第12章</h2><p>传12:1<blockquote><p>Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the days of trouble come and the years approach when you will say, “I find no pleasure in them”–<p>你趁着年幼，衰败的日子尚未来到，就是你所说“我毫无喜乐”的那些年日未曾临近之先，当记念造你的主！</blockquote><p>传12:2<blockquote><p>before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars grow dark, and the clouds return after the rain;<p>不要等到日头、光明、月亮、星宿变为黑暗，雨后云彩反回；</blockquote><p>传12:3<blockquote><p>when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men stoop, when the grinders cease because they are few, and those looking through the windows grow dim;<p>看守房屋的发颤，有力的屈身，推磨的稀少就止息；从窗户往外看的都昏暗，</blockquote><p>传12:4<blockquote><p>when the doors to the street are closed and the sound of grinding fades; when men rise up at the sound of birds, but all their songs grow faint;<p>街门关闭，推磨的响声微小，雀鸟一叫，人就起来，歌唱的女子也都衰微。</blockquote><p>传12:5<blockquote><p>when men are afraid of heights and of dangers in the streets; when the almond tree blossoms and the grasshopper drags himself along and desire no longer is stirred. Then man goes to his eternal home and mourners go about the streets.<p>人怕高处，路上有惊慌；杏树开花，蚱蜢成为重担；人所愿的也都废掉。因为人归他永远的家，吊丧的在街上往来。</blockquote><p>传12:6<blockquote><p>Remember him–before the silver cord is severed, or the golden bowl is broken; before the pitcher is shattered at the spring, or the wheel broken at the well,<p>银链折断，金罐破裂，瓶子在泉旁损坏，水轮在井口破烂；</blockquote><p>传12:7<blockquote><p>and the dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.<p>尘土仍归于地，灵仍归于赐灵的　神。</blockquote><p>传12:8<blockquote><p>“Meaningless! Meaningless!” says the Teacher. “Everything is meaningless!”<p>传道者说：“虚空的虚空，凡事都是虚空。”</blockquote><p>传12:9<blockquote><p>Not only was the Teacher wise, but also he imparted knowledge to the people. He pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs.<p>再者，传道者因有智慧，仍将知识教训众人；又默想，又考查，又陈说许多箴言。</blockquote><p>传12:10<blockquote><p>The Teacher searched to find just the right words, and what he wrote was upright and true.<p>传道者专心寻求可喜悦的言语，是凭正直写的诚实话。</blockquote><p>传12:11<blockquote><p>The words of the wise are like goads, their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails–given by one Shepherd.<p>智慧人的言语好像刺棍；会中之师的言语又像钉稳的钉子，都是一个牧者所赐的。</blockquote><p>传12:12<blockquote><p>Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them. Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body.<p>我儿，还有一层，你当受劝戒：著书多，没有穷尽；读书多，身体疲倦。</blockquote><p>传12:13<blockquote><p>Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.<p>这些事都已听见了，总意就是敬畏　神，谨守他的诫命，这是人所当尽的本分（或作“这是众人的本分”）。</blockquote><p>传12:14<blockquote><p>For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.<p>因为人所做的事，连一切隐藏的事，无论是善是恶，　神都必审问。</blockquote></article><footer role="contentinfo"><hr/><p><small class="copyright">© Seon Zhu 2022.
