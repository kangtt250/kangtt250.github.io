fullness of Christ.<p>直等到我们众人在真道上同归于一，认识　神的儿子，得以长大成人，满有基督长成的身量，</blockquote><p>弗4:14<blockquote><p>Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming.<p>使我们不再作小孩子，中了人的诡计和欺骗的法术，被一切异教之风摇动，飘来飘去，就随从各样的异端。</blockquote><p>弗4:15<blockquote><p>Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ.<p>惟用爱心说诚实话，凡事长进，连于元首基督。</blockquote><p>弗4:16<blockquote><p>From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.<p>全身都靠他联络得合式，百节各按各职，照着各体的功用彼此相助，便叫身体渐渐增长，在爱中建立自己。</blockquote><p>弗4:17<blockquote><p>So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.<p>所以我说，且在主里确实地说，你们行事，不要再像外邦人存虚妄的心行事。</blockquote><p>弗4:18<blockquote><p>They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.<p>他们心地昏昧，与　神所赐的生命隔绝了，都因自己无知，心里刚硬；</blockquote><p>弗4:19<blockquote><p>Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more.<p>良心既然丧尽，就放纵私欲，贪行种种的污秽。</blockquote><p>弗4:20<blockquote><p>You, however, did not come to know Christ that way.<p>你们学了基督，却不是这样。</blockquote><p>弗4:21<blockquote><p>Surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.<p>如果你们听过他的道，领了他的教，学了他的真理，</blockquote><p>弗4:22<blockquote><p>You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;<p>就要脱去你们从前行为上的旧人，这旧人是因私欲的迷惑渐渐变坏的。</blockquote><p>弗4:23<blockquote><p>to be made new in the attitude of your minds;<p>又要将你们的心志改换一新，</blockquote><p>弗4:24<blockquote><p>and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.<p>并且穿上新人，这新人是照着　神的形像造的，有真理的仁义和圣洁。</blockquote><p>弗4:25<blockquote><p>Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all members of one body.<p>所以你们要弃绝谎言，各人与邻舍说实话，因为我们是互相为肢体。</blockquote><p>弗4:26<blockquote><p>“In your anger do not sin”: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry,<p>生气却不要犯罪，不可含怒到日落；</blockquote><p>弗4:27<blockquote><p>and do not give the devil a foothold.<p>也不可给魔鬼留地步。</blockquote><p>弗4:28<blockquote><p>He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with his own hands, that he may have something to share with those in need.<p>从前偷窃的，不要再偷；总要劳力，亲手做正经事，就可有余，分给那缺少的人。</blockquote><p>弗4:29<blockquote><p>Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.<p>污秽的言语，一句不可出口，只要随事说造就人的好话，叫听见的人得益处。</blockquote><p>弗4:30<blockquote><p>And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.<p>不要叫　神的圣灵担忧；你们原是受了他的印记，等候得赎的日子来到。</blockquote><p>弗4:31<blockquote><p>Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.<p>一切苦毒、恼恨、忿怒、嚷闹、毁谤，并一切的恶毒（或作“阴毒”），都当从你们中间除掉。</blockquote><p>弗4:32<blockquote><p>Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.<p>并要以恩慈相待，存怜悯的心，彼此饶恕，正如　神在基督里饶恕了你们一样。</blockquote><h2 id="以弗所书第5章">以弗所书第5章</h2><p>弗5:1<blockquote><p>Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children<p>所以你们该效法　神，好像蒙慈爱的儿女一样。</blockquote><p>弗5:2<blockquote><p>and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.<p>也要凭爱心行事，正如基督爱我们，为我们舍了自己，当作馨香的供物和祭物献与　神。</blockquote><p>弗5:3<blockquote><p>But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God’s holy people.<p>至于淫乱并一切污秽，或是贪婪，在你们中间连提都不可，方合圣徒的体统。</blockquote><p>弗5:4<blockquote><p>Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.<p>淫词、妄语和戏笑的话都不相宜，总要说感谢的话。</blockquote><p>弗5:5<blockquote><p>For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person–such a man is an idolater–has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.<p>因为你们确实地知道，无论是淫乱的，是污秽的，是有贪心的，在基督和　神的国里都是无分的。有贪心的，就与拜偶像的一样。</blockquote><p>弗5:6<blockquote><p>Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God’s wrath comes on those who are disobedient.<p>不要被人虚浮的话欺哄，因这些事，　神的忿怒必临到那悖逆之子。</blockquote><p>弗5:7<blockquote><p>Therefore do not be partners with them.<p>所以你们不要与他们同夥。</blockquote><p>弗5:8<blockquote><p>For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light<p>从前你们是暗昧的，但如今在主里面是光明的，行事为人就当像光明的子女。</blockquote><p>弗5:9<blockquote><p>(for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth)<p>光明所结的果子就是一切良善、公义、诚实。</blockquote><p>弗5:10<blockquote><p>and find out what pleases the Lord.<p>总要察验何为主所喜悦的事。</blockquote><p>弗5:11<blockquote><p>Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.<p>那暗昧无益的事，不要与人同行，倒要责备行这事的人。</blockquote><p>弗5:12<blockquote><p>For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.<p>因为他们暗中所行的，就是提起来也是可耻的。</blockquote><p>弗5:13<blockquote><p>But everything exposed by the light becomes visible,<p>凡事受了责备，就被光显明出来，因为一切能显明的就是光。</blockquote><p>弗5:14<blockquote><p>for it is light that makes everything visible. This is why it is said: “Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”<p>所以主说：“你这睡着的人当醒过来，从死里复活，基督就要光照你了。”</blockquote><p>弗5:15<blockquote><p>Be very careful, then, how you live–not as unwise but as wise,<p>你们要谨慎行事，不要像愚昧人，当像智慧人。</blockquote><p>弗5:16<blockquote><p>making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.<p>要爱惜光阴，因为现今的世代邪恶。</blockquote><p>弗5:17<blockquote><p>Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is.<p>不要作糊涂人，要明白主的旨意如何。</blockquote><p>弗5:18<blockquote><p>Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.<p>不要醉酒，酒能使人放荡，乃要被圣灵充满。</blockquote><p>弗5:19<blockquote><p>Speak to one another with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord,<p>当用诗章、颂词、灵歌彼此对说，口唱心和地赞美主。</blockquote><p>弗5:20<blockquote><p>always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.<p>凡事要奉我们主耶稣基督的名，常常感谢父　神。</blockquote><p>弗5:21<blockquote><p>Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.<p>又当存敬畏基督的心，彼此顺服。</blockquote><p>弗5:22<blockquote><p>Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.<p>你们作妻子的，当顺服自己的丈夫，如同顺服主。</blockquote><p>弗5:23<blockquote><p>For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.<p>因为丈夫是妻子的头，如同基督是教会的头，他又是教会全体的救主。</blockquote><p>弗5:24<blockquote><p>Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.<p>教会怎样顺服基督，妻子也要怎样凡事顺服丈夫。</blockquote><p>弗5:25<blockquote><p>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her<p>你们作丈夫的，要爱你们的妻子，正如基督爱教会，为教会舍己。</blockquote><p>弗5:26<blockquote><p>to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,<p>要用水藉着道把教会洗净，成为圣洁，</blockquote><p>弗5:27<blockquote><p>and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.<p>可以献给自己，作个荣耀的教会，毫无玷污、皱纹等类的病，乃是圣洁没有瑕疵的。</blockquote><p>弗5:28<blockquote><p>In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.<p>丈夫也当照样爱妻子，如同爱自己的身子，爱妻子便是爱自己了。</blockquote><p>弗5:29<blockquote><p>After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church–<p>从来没有人恨恶自己的身子，总是保养顾惜，正像基督待教会一样，</blockquote><p>弗5:30<blockquote><p>for we are members of his body.<p>因我们是他身上的肢体（有古卷在此有“就是他的骨、他的肉”）。</blockquote><p>弗5:31<blockquote><p>“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”<p>为这个缘故，人要离开父母，与妻子连合，二人成为一体。</blockquote><p>弗5:32<blockquote><p>This is a profound mystery–but I am talking about Christ and the church.<p>这是极大的奥秘，但我是指着基督和教会说的。</blockquote><p>弗5:33<blockquote><p>However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.<p>然而你们各人都当爱妻子，如同爱自己一样；妻子也当敬重她的丈夫。</blockquote><h2 id="以弗所书第6章">以弗所书第6章</h2><p>弗6:1<blockquote><p>Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.<p>你们作儿女的，要在主里听从父母，这是理所当然的。</blockquote><p>弗6:2<blockquote><p>“Honor your father and mother”–which is the first commandment with a promise–<p>要孝敬父母，使你得福，在世长寿。</blockquote><p>弗6:3<blockquote><p>“that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.”<p>这是第一条带应许的诫命。</blockquote><p>弗6:4<blockquote><p>Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.<p>你们作父亲的，不要惹儿女的气，只要照着主的教训和警戒养育他们。</blockquote><p>弗6:5<blockquote><p>Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.<p>你们作仆人的，要惧怕战兢，用诚实的心听从你们肉身的主人，好像听从基督一般。</blockquote><p>弗6:6<blockquote><p>Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but like slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart.<p>不要只在眼前事奉，像是讨人喜欢的，要像基督的仆人，从心里遵行　神的旨意，</blockquote><p>弗6:7<blockquote><p>Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men,<p>甘心事奉，好像服事主，不像服事人。</blockquote><p>弗6:8<blockquote><p>because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does, whether he is slave or free.<p>因为晓得各人所行的善事，不论是为奴的、是自主的，都必按所行的，得主的赏赐。</blockquote><p>弗6:9<blockquote><p>And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him.<p>你们作主人的待仆人也是一理，不要威吓他们，因为知道他们和你们同有一位主在天上，他并不偏待人。</blockquote><p>弗6:10<blockquote><p>Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.<p>我还有末了的话：你们要靠着主，倚赖他的大能大力，作刚强的人。</blockquote><p>弗6:11<blockquote><p>Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes.<p>要穿戴　神所赐的全副军装，就能抵挡魔鬼的诡计。</blockquote><p>弗6:12<blockquote><p>For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.<p>因我们并不是与属血气的争战，乃是与那些执政的、掌权的、管辖这幽暗世界的，以及天空属灵气的恶魔争战（两“争战”原文都作“摔跤”）。</blockquote><p>弗6:13<blockquote><p>Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.<p>所以，要拿起　神所赐的全副军装，好在磨难的日子抵挡仇敌，并且成就了一切，还能站立得住。</blockquote><p>弗6:14<blockquote><p>Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place,<p>所以要站稳了，用真理当作带子束腰，用公义当作护心镜遮胸，</blockquote><p>弗6:15<blockquote><p>and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.<p>又用平安的福音当作预备走路的鞋穿在脚上。</blockquote><p>弗6:16<blockquote><p>In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.<p>此外，又拿着信德当作藤牌，可以灭尽那恶者一切的火箭。</blockquote><p>弗6:17<blockquote><p>Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.<p>并戴上救恩的头盔，拿着圣灵的宝剑，就是　神的道。</blockquote><p>弗6:18<blockquote><p>And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.<p>靠着圣灵，随时多方祷告祈求，并要在此警醒不倦，为众圣徒祈求，</blockquote><p>弗6:19<blockquote><p>Pray also for me, that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,<p>也为我祈求，使我得着口才，能以放胆开口讲明福音的奥秘，</blockquote><p>弗6:20<blockquote><p>for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should.<p>（我为这福音的奥秘作了带锁链的使者）并使我照着当尽的本分放胆讲论。</blockquote><p>弗6:21<blockquote><p>Tychicus, the dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell you everything, so that you also may know how I am and what I am doing.<p>今有所亲爱、忠心事奉主的兄弟推基古，他要把我的事情并我的景况如何全告诉你们，叫你们知道。</blockquote><p>弗6:22<blockquote><p>I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are, and that he may encourage you.<p>我特意打发他到你们那里去，好叫你们知道我们的光景，又叫他安慰你们的心。</blockquote><p>弗6:23<blockquote><p>Peace to the brothers, and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<p>愿平安、仁爱、信心，从父　神和主耶稣基督，归与弟兄们。</blockquote><p>弗6:24<blockquote><p>Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.<p>并愿所有诚心爱我们主耶稣基督的人，都蒙恩惠。</blockquote></article><footer role="contentinfo"><hr/><p><small class="copyright">© Seon Zhu 2022.
