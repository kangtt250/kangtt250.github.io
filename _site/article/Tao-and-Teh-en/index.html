of<p>Is not the Absolute Tao;<p>The Names that can be given<p>Are not Absolute Names.<p>The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;<p>The Named is the Mother of All Things.<p>Therefore:<p>Oftentimes, one strips oneself of passion<p>In order to see the Secret of Life;<p>Oftentimes, one regards life with passion,<p>In order to see its manifest forms.<p>These two (the Secret and its manifestations)<p>Are (in their nature) the same;<p>They are given different names<p>When they become manifest.<p>They may both be called the Cosmic Mystery:<p>Reaching from the Mystery into the Deeper Mystery<p>Is the Gate to the Secret of All Life.<hr /><h3 id="二章">二章</h3><p>天下皆知美之为美，斯恶已；皆知善之为善，斯不善矣。有无相生，难易相成，长短相形，高下相盈，音声相和，前后相随，恒也。是以圣人处无为之事，行不言之教，万物作而弗始，生而弗有，为而弗恃，功成而弗居。夫唯弗居，是以不去。<p>When the people of the Earth all know beauty as beauty,<p>There arises (the recognition of) ugliness.<p>When the people of the Earth all know the good as good,<p>There arises (the recognition of) evil.<p>Therefore:<p>Being and non-being interdepend in growth;<p>Difficult and easy interdepend in completion;<p>Long and short interdepend in contrast;<p>High and low interdepend in position;<p>Tones and voice interdepend in harmony;<p>Front and behind interdepend in company.<p>Therefore the Sage:<p>Manages affairs without action;<p>Preaches the doctrine without words;<p>All things take their rise, but he does not turn away from them;<p>He gives them life, but does not take possession of them;<p>He acts, but does not appropriate;<p>Accomplishes, butclaims no credit.<p>It is because he lays claim to no credit<p>That the credit cannot be taken away from him.<hr /><h3 id="三章">三章</h3><p>不尚贤，使民不争；不贵难得之货，使民不为盗；不见可欲，使民心不乱。是以圣人之治，虚其心，实其腹；弱其志，强其骨。常使民无知无欲。使夫知不敢弗为而已，则无不治。<p>Exalt not the wise,<p>So that the people shall not scheme and contend;<p>Prize not rare objects,<p>So that the people shall not steal;<p>Shut out from site the things of desire,<p>So that the people’s hearts shall not be disturbed.<p>Therefore in the government of the Sage:<p>He keeps empty their hearts<p>Makes full their bellies,<p>Discourages their ambitions,<p>Strengthens their frames;<p>So that the people may be innocent of knowledge and desires.<p>And the cunning ones shall not presume to interfere.<p>By action without deeds<p>May all live in peace.<hr /><h3 id="四章">四章</h3><p>道冲，而用之或不盈。渊兮，似万物之宗。挫其锐，解其纷，和其光，同其尘。湛兮，似或存。吾不知谁之子，象帝之先。<p>Tao is a hollow vessel,<p>And its use is inexhaustible!<p>Fathomless!<p>Like the fountain head of all things,<p>Its sharp edges rounded off,<p>Its tangles untied,<p>Its light tempered,<p>Its turmoil submerged,<p>Yet dark like deep water it seems to remain.<p>I do not know whose Son it it,<p>An image of what existed before God.<hr /><h3 id="五章">五章</h3><p>天地不仁，以万物为刍狗；圣人不仁，以百姓为刍狗。天地之间，其犹橐龠乎？虚而不屈，动而愈出。多闻数穷，不如守中。<p>Nature is unkind:<p>It treats the creation like sacrificial straw-dogs.<p>The Sage is unkind:<p>He treats the people like sacrificial straw-dogs.<p>How the universe is like a bellows!<p>Empty, yet it gives a supply that never fails;<p>The more it is worked, the more it brings forth.<p>By many words is wit exhausted.<p>Rather, therefore, hold to the core.<hr /><h3 id="六章">六章</h3><p>谷神不死，是谓玄牝。玄牝之门，是谓天地根。绵绵若存，用之不勤。<p>The Spirit of the Valley never dies.<p>It is called the Mystic Female.<p>The Door of the Mystic Female<p>Is the root of Heaven and Earth.<p>Continuously, continuously,<p>It seems to remain.<p>Draw upon it<p>And it serves you with ease.<hr /><h3 id="七章">七章</h3><p>天长地久。天地所以能长且久者，以其不自生，故能长生。是以圣人后其身而身先，外其身而身存。不以其无私邪？故能成其私。<p>The universe is everlasting.<p>The reason the universe is everlasting<p>Is that it does not life for Self.<p>Therefore it can long endure.<p>Therefore the Sage puts himself last,<p>And finds himself in the foremost place;<p>Regards his body as accidental,<p>And his body is thereby preserved.<p>Is it not because he does not live for Self<p>That his Self is realized?<hr /><h3 id="八章">八章</h3><p>上善若水。水善利万物而不争，居众人之所恶，故几于道。居善地，心善渊，与善仁，言善信，政善治，事善能，动善时。夫唯不争，故无尤。<p>The best of men is like water;<p>Water benefits all things<p>And does not compete with them.<p>It dwells in (the lowly) places that all disdain -<p>Wherein it comes near to the Tao.<p>In his dwelling, (the Sage) loves the (lowly) earth;<p>In his heart, he loves what is profound;<p>In his relations with others, he loves kindness;<p>In his words, he loves sincerity;<p>In government, he loves peace;<p>In business affairs, he loves ability;<p>In hi actions, he loves choosing the right time.<p>It is because he does not contend<p>That he is without reproach.<hr /><h3 id="九章">九章</h3><p>持而盈之，不如其已。揣而锐之，不可长保。金玉满堂，莫之能守。富贵而骄，自遗其咎。功遂身退，天下之道。<p>Stretch (a bow) to the very full,<p>And you will wish you had stopped in time.<p>Temper a (sword-edge) toits very sharpest,<p>And the edge will not last long.<p>When gold and jade fill your hall,<p>You will not be able to keep them safe.<p>To be proud with wealth and honor<p>Is to sow seeds of one’s own downfall.<p>Retire when your work is done,<p>Such is Heaven’s way.<hr /><h3 id="十章">十章</h3><p>载营魄抱一，能无离乎？专气致柔，能如婴儿乎？修除玄览，能无疵乎？爱民治国，能无智乎？天门开阖，能为雌乎？明白四达，能无知乎？生之、畜之，生而不有，长而不宰。是为玄德。<p>In embracing the One with your soul,<p>Can you never forsake the Tao?<p>In controlling your vital force to achieve gentleness,<p>Can you become like the new-born child?<p>In cleansing and purifying your Mystic vision,<p>Can you strive after perfection?<p>In loving the people and governing the kingdom,<p>Can you rule without interference?<p>In opening and shutting the Gate of Heaven,<p>Can you play the part of the Female?<p>In comprehending all knowledge,<p>Can yourenounce the mind?<hr /><h3 id="十一章">十一章</h3><p>三十辐共一毂，当其无，有车之用。埏埴以为器，当其无，有器之用。凿户牖以为室，当其无，有室之用。故有之以为利，无之以为用。<p>Thirty spokes unite around the nave;<p>From their not-being (loss of their individuality)<p>Arises the utility of the wheel.<p>Mold clay into a vessel;<p>From its not-being (in the vessel’s hollow)<p>Arises the utility of the vessel.<p>Cut out doors and windows in the house (-wall),<p>From their not-being (empty space) arises the utility<p>of the house.<p>Therefore by the existence of things we profit.<p>And by the non-existence of things we are served.<hr /><h3 id="十二章">十二章</h3><p>五色令人目盲；五音令人耳聋；五味令人口爽；驰骋畋猎，令人心发狂；难得之货，令人行妨。是以圣人为腹不为目，故去彼取此。<p>The five colors blind the eyes of man;<p>The five musical notes deafen the ears of man;<p>The five flavors dull the taste of man;<p>Horse-racing, hunting and chasing madden the minds of man;<p>Rare, valuable goods keep their owners awake at night.<p>Therefore the Sage:<p>Provides for the belly and not the eye.<p>Hence, he rejects the one and accepts the other.<hr /><h3 id="十三章">十三章</h3><p>宠辱若惊，贵大患若身。何谓宠辱若惊？宠为下，得之若惊，失之若惊，是谓宠辱若惊。何谓贵大患若身？吾所以有大患者，为吾有身，及吾无身，吾有何患？故贵以身为天下，若可寄天下；爱以身为天下，若可托天下。<p>‘Favor and disgrace cause one dismay;<p>What we value and what we fear are within our Self.’<p>What does this mean:<p>‘Favor and disgrace cause one dismay?’<p>Those who receive a favor from above<p>Are dismayed when they receive it,<p>And dismayed when they lose it.<p>What does this mean:<p>‘What we value and what we fear are within our Self?’<p>We have fears because we have a self.<p>When we do not regard that self as self,<p>What have we to fear?<p>Therefore he who values the world as his self<p>May thenbe entrusted with the government of the world;<p>And he who loves the world as his self -<p>The world may then be entrusted to his care.<hr /><h3 id="十四章">十四章</h3><p>视之不见，名曰微；听之不闻，名曰希；搏之不得，名曰夷。此三者，不可致诘，故混而为一。其上不皎，其下不昧，绳绳兮不可名，复归于物。是谓无状之状，无物之象，是谓惚恍。迎之不见其首，随之不见其后。执古之道，以御今之有。能知古始，是谓道纪。<p>Looked at, but cannot be seen -<p>That is called the Invisible (yi).<p>Listened to, but cannot be heard -<p>That is called the Inaudible (hsi).<p>Grasped at, but cannot be touched -<p>That is called the Intangible (wei).<p>These three elude our inquiries<p>And hence blend and become One.<p>Not by its rising, is there light,<p>Nor by its sinking, is there darkness.<p>Unceasing, continuous,<p>It cannot be defined,<p>And reverts again to the realm of nothingness.<p>That is why it is called the Form of the Formless,<p>The Image of Nothingness.<p>That is why it is calledthe Elusive:<p>Meet it and you do not see its face;<p>Follow it and you do not see its back.<hr /><h3 id="十五章">十五章</h3><p>古之善为道者，微妙玄通，深不可识。夫唯不可识，故强为之容：豫兮，若冬涉川；犹兮，若畏四邻；俨兮，其若客；涣兮，其若凌释；敦兮，其若朴；旷兮，其若谷；混兮，其若浊。孰能浊以止？静之徐清。孰能安以久？动之徐生。保此道者，不欲盈。夫唯不盈，故能蔽而新成。<p>The wise ones of old had subtle wisdom and depth of understanding,<p>So profound that they could not be understood.<p>And because they could not be understood,<p>Perforce must they be so described:<p>Cautious, like crossing a wintry stream,<p>Irresolute, like one fearing danger all around,<p>Grave, like one acting as guest,<p>Self-effacing, like ice beginning to melt,<p>Genuine, like a piece of undressed wood,<p>Open-minded, like a valley,<p>And mixing freely, like murky water.<p>Who can find repose in a muddy world?<p>By lying still, it becomes clear.<p>Who can maintain his calm for long?<p>By activity, it comes back to life.<p>He who embraces this Tao<p>Guards against being over-full.<p>Because he guards against being over-full,<p>He is beyond wearing out and renewal.<hr /><h3 id="十六章">十六章</h3><p>致虚极，守静笃。万物并作，吾以观复。夫物芸芸，各复归其根。归根曰静，静曰复命。复命曰常，知常曰明。不知常，妄作，凶。知常容，容乃公，公乃王，王乃天，天乃道，道乃久，殁身不殆。<p>Attain the utmost in Passivity,<p>Hold firm to the basis of Quietude.<p>The myriad things take shape and rise to activity,<p>But I watch them fall back to their repose.<p>Like vegetation that luxuriantly grows<p>But returns to the root (soil) from which it springs.<p>To return to the root is Repose;<p>It is called going back to one’s Destiny.<p>Going back to one’s Destiny is to find the Eternal Law.<p>To know the Eternal Law is Enlightenment.<p>And not to know the Eternal Law<p>Is to court disaster.<p>He who knows the Eternal Law is tolerant;<p>Being tolerant, he is impartial;<p>Being impartial, he is kingly;<p>Being kingly, he is in accord with Nature;<p>Being in accord with Nature, he is in accord with Tao;<p>Being in accord with Tao, he is eternal,<p>And his whole life is preserved from harm.<hr /><h3 id="十七章">十七章</h3><p>太上，不知有之；其次，亲而誉之；其次，畏之；其次，侮之。信不足焉，有不信焉。悠兮，其贵言。功成事遂，百姓皆谓：「我自然」。<p>Of the best rulers<p>The people (only) know that they exist;<p>The next best the love and praise;<p>The next they fear;<p>And the next they revile.<p>When they do not command the people’s faith,<p>Some will lose faith in them,<p>And then they resort to oaths!<p>But (of the best) when their task is accomplished,<p>their work done,<p>The people all remark, ‘We have done it ourselves.’<hr /><h3 id="十八章">十八章</h3><p>大道废，有仁义；智慧出，有大伪；六亲不和，有孝慈；国家昏乱，有忠臣。<p>On the decline of the great Tao,<p>The doctrine of ‘humanity’ and ‘justice’ arose.<p>When knowledge and cleverness appeared,<p>Great hypocrisy followed in its wake.<p>When the six relationships no longer lived at peace,<p>There was (praise of) ‘kind parents’ and ‘filial sons.’<p>When a country fell into chaos and misrule,<p>There was (praise of) ‘loyal ministers.’<hr /><h3 id="十九章">十九章</h3><p>绝圣弃智，民利百倍；绝仁弃义，民复孝慈；绝巧弃利，盗贼无有。此三者以为文，不足。故令有所属：见素抱朴，少思寡欲，绝学无忧。<p>Banish wisdom, discard knowledge,<p>And the people shall profit a hundredfold;<p>Banish ‘humanity,’ discard ‘justice,’<p>And the people shall recover love of their kin;<p>Banish cunning, discard ‘utility,’<p>And the thieves and brigands shall disappear.<p>As these three touch the externals and are inadequate,<p>The people have need of what they can depend upon:<p>Reveal thy simple self,<p>Embrace thy original nature,<p>Check thy selfishness,<p>Curtail thy desires.<hr /><h3 id="二十章">二十章</h3><p>唯之与阿，相去几何？美之与恶，相去若何？人之所畏，不可不畏。荒兮，其未央哉！众人熙熙，如享太牢，如春登台。我独泊兮，其未兆；沌沌兮，如婴儿之未孩；儡儡兮，若无所归。众人皆有馀，而我独若遗。我愚人之心也哉，沌沌兮！俗人昭昭，我独昏昏。俗人察察，我独闷闷。淡兮，其若海，望兮，若无止。众人皆有以，而我独顽似鄙。我独异于人，而贵食母。<p>Banish learning, and vexations end.<p>Between ‘Ah!’ and ‘Ough!’<p>How much difference is there?<p>Between ‘good’ and ‘evil’<p>How much difference is there?’<p>That which men fear<p>Is indeed to be feared;<p>But, alas, distant yet is the dawn (of awakening)!<p>The people of the world are merry-making,<p>As if partaking of the sacrificial feasts,<p>As if mounting the terrace in spring;<p>I alone am mild, like one unemployed,<p>Like a new-born babe that cannot yet smile,<p>Unattached, like one without a home.<p>The people of the world have enough and to spare,<p>But I am like one left

depressed.<p>Patient as the sea,<p>Adrift, seemingly aimless.<p>The people of the world all have a purpose;<p>I alone appear stubborn and uncouth.<p>I alone differ from the other people,<p>And value
