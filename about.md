# What is this Game?

Katt Viteză is a 2D high-speed platformer developed on the Unity Engine. Set in a vibrant 
cartoon world brought to life by eye-catching pixel art, the player’s primary goal is to 
reach the end of each level safely, and then defeat that level’s boss. The game will be 
won if the player can beat the boss of the fourth and final level. However, true completion
will require the player to return to each level and discover the secrets in all of the areas
they couldn’t reach previously, when they lacked certain abilities. The player will have to 
master both high-speed movement and careful, strategic platforming if they want to prevail.

# Story

Strange mechanical beings known as the Maskineri have invaded Katt’s mountain forest, stealing
its natural resources, some cutting down trees, others taking the fish from the rivers. 
When they take her friends away, Katt decides to pursue the automaton kidnappers in a bid to 
rescue them.

Run, jump and blast your way to the end goal! Move at top speed to get to the end as fast as 
possible, or take it slow and explore the nooks and crannies of each level. Either way, there’s
no escaping a confrontation with the menacing bosses that stand in your way!

# Race to the Finish, or Explore the Unknown

It’s up to you, do you want to see how fast Katt can really go? Or do you want to satisfy your
curious nature and explore every inch of every level? Who knows, you may find something that 
could give you an advantage in a future battle.

# Obtain Incredible Equipment and Abilities

Beat bosses and you’ll obtain abilities that will provide Katt with even more options at her 
disposable, like a Glider that increases her air time, or a pair of shoes that allows her to 
double jump.

# Become a Speed Demon

Defeat enemies to increase your Power Gauge, when it’s filled, you can activate Katt’s “Speed 
Demon Form”. In this form, Katt’s abilities become super-powered. She’s invulnerable, she can 
build up momentum much quicker and her blaster becomes mega-powerful. This form won’t last very
long though, if you can enable it, it’s best to save it for a rainy day.

# Victory Conditions

To prevail you must reach the boss of the fourth and final stage. To clear a stage, you must 
reach the end and defeat the boss of that stage, then you may progress to the next stage. Will
you be able to make it all the way to the final foe? Good luck!
