if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer.<p>我们受患难呢，是为叫你们得安慰得拯救。我们得安慰呢，也是为叫你们得安慰。这安慰能叫你们忍受我们所受的那样苦楚。</blockquote><p>林后1:7<blockquote><p>And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort.<p>我们为你们所存的盼望是确定的。因为知道你们既是同受苦楚，也必同得安慰。</blockquote><p>林后1:8<blockquote><p>We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about the hardships we suffered in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life.<p>弟兄们，我们不要你们不晓得，我们从前在亚细亚遭遇苦难，被压太重，力不能胜，甚至连活命的指望都绝了。</blockquote><p>林后1:9<blockquote><p>Indeed, in our hearts we felt the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.<p>自己心里也断定是必死的，叫我们不靠自己，只靠叫死人复活的　神。</blockquote><p>林后1:10<blockquote><p>He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us,<p>他曾救我们脱离那极大的死亡，现在仍要救我们，并且我们指望他将来还要救我们。</blockquote><p>林后1:11<blockquote><p>as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many.<p>你们以祈祷帮助我们，好叫许多人为我们谢恩，就是为我们因许多人所得的恩。</blockquote><p>林后1:12<blockquote><p>Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, in the holiness and sincerity that are from God. We have done so not according to worldly wisdom but according to God’s grace.<p>我们所夸的，是自己的良心，见证我们凭着　神的圣洁和诚实，在世为人，不靠人的聪明，乃靠　神的恩惠，向你们更是这样。</blockquote><p>林后1:13<blockquote><p>For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that,<p>我们现在写给你们的话，并不外乎你们所念的，所认识的，我也盼望你们到底还是要认识。</blockquote><p>林后1:14<blockquote><p>as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus.<p>正如你们已经有几分认识我们。以我们夸口，好像我们在我们主耶稣的日子，以你们夸口一样。</blockquote><p>林后1:15<blockquote><p>Because I was confident of this, I planned to visit you first so that you might benefit twice.<p>我既然这样深信，就早有意到你们那里去，叫你们再得益处。</blockquote><p>林后1:16<blockquote><p>I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea.<p>也要从你们那里经过，往马其顿去，再从马其顿回到你们那里，叫你们给我送行往犹太去。</blockquote><p>林后1:17<blockquote><p>When I planned this, did I do it lightly? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say, “Yes, yes” and “No, no”?<p>我有此意，岂是反复不定吗。我所起的意，岂是从情欲起的，叫我忽是忽非吗。</blockquote><p>林后1:18<blockquote><p>But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not “Yes” and “No.”<p>我指着信实的　神说，我们向你们所传的道，并没有是而又非的。</blockquote><p>林后1:19<blockquote><p>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by me and Silas and Timothy, was not “Yes” and “No,” but in him it has always been “Yes.”<p>因为我和西拉，并提摩太，在你们中间所传　神的儿子耶稣基督，总没有是而又非的，在他只有一是。</blockquote><p>林后1:20<blockquote><p>For no matter how many promises God has made, they are “Yes” in Christ. And so through him the “Amen” is spoken by us to the glory of God.<p>神的应许，不论有多少，在基督都是是的，所以藉着他也都是实在的（“实在”原文作“阿们”），叫　神因我们得荣耀。</blockquote><p>林后1:21<blockquote><p>Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us,<p>那在基督里坚固我们和你们，并且膏我们的，就是　神。</blockquote><p>林后1:22<blockquote><p>set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.<p>他又用印印了我们，并赐圣灵在我们心里作凭据（原文作“质”）。</blockquote><p>林后1:23<blockquote><p>I call God as my witness that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.<p>我呼吁　神给我的心作见证，我没有往哥林多去，是为要宽容你们。</blockquote><p>林后1:24<blockquote><p>Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, because it is by faith you stand firm.<p>我们并不是辖管你们的信心，乃是帮助你们的快乐。因为你们凭信才站立得住。</blockquote><h2 id="哥林多后书第2章">哥林多后书第2章</h2><p>林后2:1<blockquote><p>So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you.<p>我自己定了主意，再到你们那里去，必须大家没有忧愁。</blockquote><p>林后2:2<blockquote><p>For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved?<p>倘若我叫你们忧愁，除了我叫那忧愁的人以外，谁能叫我快乐呢。</blockquote><p>林后2:3<blockquote><p>I wrote as I did so that when I came I should not be distressed by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy.<p>我曾把这事写给你们，恐怕我到的时候，应该叫我快乐的那些人，反倒叫我忧愁。我也深信，你们众人都以我的快乐为自己的快乐。</blockquote><p>林后2:4<blockquote><p>For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you.<p>我先前心里难过痛苦，多多的流泪，写信给你们。不是叫你们忧愁，乃是叫你们知道我格外的疼爱你们。</blockquote><p>林后2:5<blockquote><p>If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you, to some extent–not to put it too severely.<p>若有叫人忧愁的，他不但叫我忧愁，也是叫你们众人有几分忧愁，我说几分，恐怕说得太重。</blockquote><p>林后2:6<blockquote><p>The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient for him.<p>这样的人，受了众人的责罚，也就够了。</blockquote><p>林后2:7<blockquote><p>Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.<p>倒不如赦免他，安慰他，免得他忧愁太过，甚至沉沦了。</blockquote><p>林后2:8<blockquote><p>I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him.<p>所以我劝你们，要向他显出坚定不移的爱心来。</blockquote><p>林后2:9<blockquote><p>The reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.<p>为此我先前也写信给你们，要试验你们，看你们凡事顺从不顺从。</blockquote><p>林后2:10<blockquote><p>If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven–if there was anything to forgive–I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake,<p>你们赦免谁，我也赦免谁，我若有所赦免的，是在基督面前为你们赦免的。</blockquote><p>林后2:11<blockquote><p>in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.<p>免得撒但趁着机会胜过我们。因我们并非不晓得他的诡计。</blockquote><p>林后2:12<blockquote><p>Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me,<p>我从前为基督的福音到了特罗亚，主也给我开了门。</blockquote><p>林后2:13<blockquote><p>I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said good-by to them and went on to Macedonia.<p>那时因为没有遇见兄弟提多，我心里不安，便辞别那里的人往马其顿去了。</blockquote><p>林后2:14<blockquote><p>But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him.<p>感谢　神，常率领我们在基督里夸胜，并藉着我们在各处显扬那因认识基督而有的香气。</blockquote><p>林后2:15<blockquote><p>For we are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.<p>因为我们在　神面前，无论在得救的人身上，或灭亡的人身上，都有基督馨香之气。</blockquote><p>林后2:16<blockquote><p>To the one we are the smell of death; to the other, the fragrance of life. And who is equal to such a task?<p>在这等人，就作了死的香气叫他死。在那等人，就作了活的香气叫他活。这事谁能当得起呢。</blockquote><p>林后2:17<blockquote><p>Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, like men sent from God.<p>我们不像那许多人，为利混乱　神的道。乃是由于诚实，由于　神，在　神面前凭着基督讲道。</blockquote><h2 id="哥林多后书第3章">哥林多后书第3章</h2><p>林后3:1<blockquote><p>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you?<p>我们岂是又举荐自己吗。岂像别人，用人的荐信给你们，或用你们的荐信给人吗。</blockquote><p>林后3:2<blockquote><p>You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everybody.<p>你们就是我们的荐信，写在我们的心里，被众人所知道所念诵的。</blockquote><p>林后3:3<blockquote><p>You show that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.<p>你们明显是基督的信，藉着我们修成的。不是用墨写的，乃是用永生　神的灵写的。不是写在石版上，乃是写在心版上。</blockquote><p>林后3:4<blockquote><p>Such confidence as this is ours through Christ before God.<p>我们因基督所以在　神面前才有这样的信心，</blockquote><p>林后3:5<blockquote><p>Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God.<p>并不是我们凭自己能承担什么事，我们所能承担的，乃是出于　神。</blockquote><p>林后3:6<blockquote><p>He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant–not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.<p>他叫我们能承当这新约的执事。不是凭着字句，乃是凭着精意。因为那字句是叫人死，精意是叫人活。（精意或作圣灵）。</blockquote><p>林后3:7<blockquote><p>Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, fading though it was,<p>那用字刻在石头上属死的职事，尚且有荣光，甚至以色列人因摩西面上的荣光，不能定睛看他的脸。这荣光原是渐渐退去的。</blockquote><p>林后3:8<blockquote><p>will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?<p>何况那属灵的职事，岂不更有荣光吗。</blockquote><p>林后3:9<blockquote><p>If the ministry that condemns men is glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness!<p>若是定罪的职事有荣光，那称义的职事，荣光就越发大了。</blockquote><p>林后3:10<blockquote><p>For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory.<p>那从前有荣光的，因这极大的荣光，就算不得有荣光了。</blockquote><p>林后3:11<blockquote><p>And if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!<p>若那废掉的有荣光，这长存的就更有荣光了。</blockquote><p>林后3:12<blockquote><p>Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold.<p>我们既有这样的盼望，就大胆讲说，</blockquote><p>林后3:13<blockquote><p>We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at it while the radiance was fading away.<p>不像摩西将帕子蒙在脸上，叫以色列人不能定睛看到那将废者的结局。</blockquote><p>林后3:14<blockquote><p>But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away.<p>但他们的心地刚硬。直到今日诵读旧约的时候，这帕子还没有揭去。这帕子在基督里已经废去了。</blockquote><p>林后3:15<blockquote><p>Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.<p>然而直到今日，每逢诵读摩西书的时候，帕子还在他们心上。</blockquote><p>林后3:16<blockquote><p>But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.<p>但他们的心几时归向主，帕子就几时除去了。</blockquote><p>林后3:17<blockquote><p>Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.<p>主就是那灵。主的灵在哪里，哪里就得以自由。</blockquote><p>林后3:18<blockquote><p>And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the Lord’s glory, are being transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.<p>我们众人既然倘着脸，得以看见主的荣光，好像从镜子里反照，就变成主的形状，荣上加荣，如同从主的灵变成的。</blockquote><h2 id="哥林多后书第4章">哥林多后书第4章</h2><p>林后4:1<blockquote><p>Therefore, since through God’s mercy we have this ministry, we do not lose heart.<p>我们既然蒙怜悯，受了这职分，就不丧胆。</blockquote><p>林后4:2<blockquote><p>Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.<p>乃将那些暗昧可耻的事弃绝了，不行诡诈，不谬称　神的道理。只将真理表明出来，好在　神面前把自己荐与各人的良心。</blockquote><p>林后4:3<blockquote><p>And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.<p>如果我们的福音蒙蔽，就是蒙蔽在灭亡的人身上。</blockquote><p>林后4:4<blockquote><p>The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.<p>此等不信之人，被这世界的　神弄瞎了心眼，不叫基督荣耀福音的光照着他们。基督本是　神的像。</blockquote><p>林后4:5<blockquote><p>For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.<p>我们原不是传自己，乃是传基督耶稣为主，并且自己因耶稣作你们的仆人。</blockquote><p>林后4:6<blockquote><p>For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.<p>那吩咐光从黑暗里照出来的　神，已经照在我们心里，叫我们得知　神荣耀的光，显在耶稣基督的面上。</blockquote><p>林后4:7<blockquote><p>But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.<p>我们有这宝贝放在瓦器里，要显明这莫大的能力，是出于　神，不是出于我们。</blockquote><p>林后4:8<blockquote><p>We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;<p>我们四面受敌，却不被困住。心里作难，却不至失望。</blockquote><p>林后4:9<blockquote><p>persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.<p>遭逼迫，却不被丢弃。打倒了，却不至死亡。</blockquote><p>林后4:10<blockquote><p>We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.<p>身上常带着耶稣的死，使耶稣的生，也显明在我们身上。</blockquote><p>林后4:11<blockquote><p>For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that his life may be revealed in our mortal body.<p>因为我们这活着的人，是常为耶稣被交于死地，使耶稣的生，在我们这必死的身上显明出来，</blockquote><p>林后4:12<blockquote><p>So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.<p>这样看来，死是在我们身上发动，生却在你们身上发动。</blockquote><p>林后4:13<blockquote><p>It is written: “I believed; therefore I have spoken.” With that same spirit of faith we also believe and therefore speak,<p>但我们既有信心，正如经上记着说，我因信，所以如此说话。我们也信，所以也说话。</blockquote><p>林后4:14<blockquote><p>because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you in his presence.<p>自己知道，那叫主耶稣复活的，也必叫我们与耶稣一同复活，并且叫我们与你们一同站在他面前。</blockquote><p>林后4:15<blockquote><p>All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.<p>凡事都是为你们，好叫恩惠因人多越发加增，感谢格外显多，以致荣耀归与　神。</blockquote><p>林后4:16<blockquote><p>Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.<p>所以我们不丧胆。外体虽然毁坏，内心却一天新似一天。</blockquote><p>林后4:17<blockquote><p>For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.<p>我们这至暂至轻的苦楚，要为我们成就极重无比永远的荣耀。</blockquote><p>林后4:18<blockquote><p>So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.<p>原来我们不是顾念所见的，乃是顾念所不见的。因为所见的是暂时的，所不见的是永远的。</blockquote><h2 id="哥林多后书第5章">哥林多后书第5章</h2><p>林后5:1<blockquote><p>Now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands.<p>我们原知道，我们这地上的帐棚若拆毁了，必得　神所造，不是人手所造，在天上永存的房屋。</blockquote><p>林后5:2<blockquote><p>Meanwhile we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling,<p>我们在这帐棚里叹息，深想得那从天上来的房屋，好像穿上衣服。</blockquote><p>林后5:3<blockquote><p>because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked.<p>倘若穿上，被遇见的时候就不至于赤身了。</blockquote><p>林后5:4<blockquote><p>For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.<p>我们在这帐棚里，叹息劳苦，并非愿意脱下这个，乃是愿意穿上那个，好叫这必死的被生命吞灭了。</blockquote><p>林后5:5<blockquote><p>Now it is God who has made us for this very purpose and has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.<p>为此培植我们的就是　神，他又赐给我们圣灵作凭据。（原文作质）。</blockquote><p>林后5:6<blockquote><p>Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord.<p>所以我们时常坦然无惧，并且晓得我们住在身内，便与主相离。</blockquote><p>林后5:7<blockquote><p>We live by faith, not by sight.<p>因我们行事为人，是凭着信心，不是凭着眼见。</blockquote><p>林后5:8<blockquote><p>We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.<p>我们坦然无惧，是更愿意离开身体与主同住。</blockquote><p>林后5:9<blockquote><p>So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it.<p>所以无论是住在身内，离开身外，我们立了志向，要得主的喜悦。</blockquote><p>林后5:10<blockquote><p>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive what is due him for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.<p>因为我们众人，必要在基督台前显露出来，叫各人按着本身所行的，或善或恶受报。</blockquote><p>林后5:11<blockquote><p>Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade men. What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your conscience.<p>我们既知道主是可畏的，所以劝人，但我们在　神面前是显明的，盼望在你们的良心里，也是显明的。</blockquote><p>林后5:12<blockquote><p>We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us, so that you can answer those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart.<p>我们不是向你们再举荐自己，乃是叫你们因我们有可夸之处，好对那凭外貌不凭内心夸口的人，有言可答。</blockquote><p>林后5:13<blockquote><p>If we are out of our mind, it is for the sake of God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.<p>我们若果颠狂，是为　神。若果谨守，是为你们。</blockquote><p>林后5:14<blockquote><p>For Christ’s love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died.<p>原来基督的爱激励我们。因我们想一人既替众人死，众人就都死了。</blockquote><p>林后5:15<blockquote><p>And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.<p>并且他替众人死，是叫那些活着的人，不再为自己活，乃为替他们死而复活的主活。</blockquote><p>林后5:16<blockquote><p>So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.<p>所以我们从今以后，不凭着外貌（原文作肉体本节同）认人了。虽然凭着外貌认过基督，如今却不再这样认他了。</blockquote><p>林后5:17<blockquote><p>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!<p>若有人在基督里，他就是新造的人。旧事已过，都变成新的了。</blockquote><p>林后5:18<blockquote><p>All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation:<p>一切都是出于　神，他藉着基督使我们与他和好，又将劝人与他和好的职分赐给我们。</blockquote><p>林后5:19<blockquote><p>that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men’s sins against them.

We have been speaking in the sight of God as those in Christ; and everything we do, dear friends, is for your strengthening.<p>你们到如今，还想我们是向你们分诉。我们本是在基督里当　神面前说话。亲爱的弟兄啊，一切的事，都是为造就你们。</blockquote><p>林后12:20<blockquote><p>For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I want you to be, and you may not find me as you want me to be. I fear that there may be quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder.<p>我怕我再来的时候，见你们不合我所想望的，你们见我也不合你们所想望的。又怕有分争，嫉妒，恼怒，结党，毁谤，谗言，狂傲，混乱的事。</blockquote><p>林后12:21<blockquote><p>I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you, and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual sin and debauchery in which they have indulged.<p>且怕我来的时候，我的　神叫我在你们面前渐愧。又因许多人从前犯罪，行污秽奸淫邪荡的事，不肯悔改，我就忧愁。</blockquote><h2 id="哥林多后书第13章">哥林多后书第13章</h2><p>林后13:1<blockquote><p>This will be my third visit to you. “Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.”<p>这是我第三次要到你们那里去。凭两三个人的口作见证，句句都要定准。</blockquote><p>林后13:2<blockquote><p>I already gave you a warning when I was with you the second time. I now repeat it while absent: On my return I will not spare those who sinned earlier or any of the others,<p>我从前说过，如今不在你们那里又说，正如我第二次见你们的时候所说的一样，就是对那犯了罪的，和其余的人说，我若再来必不宽容。</blockquote><p>林后13:3<blockquote><p>since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you.<p>你们既然寻求基督在我里面说话的凭据，我必不宽容因为基督在你们身上，不是软弱的。在你们里面，是有大能的。</blockquote><p>林后13:4<blockquote><p>For to be sure, he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God’s power. Likewise, we are weak in him, yet by God’s power we will live with him to serve you.<p>他因软弱被钉在十字架上，却因　神的大能，仍然活着。我们也是这样同他软弱，但因　神向你们所显的大能，也必与他同活。</blockquote><p>林后13:5<blockquote><p>Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you–unless, of course, you fail the test?<p>你们总要自己省察有信心没有。也要自己试验。岂不知你们若不是可弃绝的，就有耶稣基督在你们心里吗。</blockquote><p>林后13:6<blockquote><p>And I trust that you will discover that we have not failed the test.<p>我却盼望你们晓得我们不是可弃绝的人。</blockquote><p>林后13:7<blockquote><p>Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong. Not that people will see that we have stood the test but that you will do what is right even though we may seem to have failed.<p>我们求　神，叫你们一件恶事都不作。这不是要显明我们是蒙悦纳的，是要你们行事端正，任凭人看我们是被弃绝的吧。</blockquote><p>林后13:8<blockquote><p>For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.<p>我们凡事不能敌挡真理，只能扶助真理。</blockquote><p>林后13:9<blockquote><p>We are glad whenever we are weak but you are strong; and our prayer is for your perfection.<p>即使我们软弱，你们刚强，我们也欢喜。并且我们所求的，就是你们作完全人。</blockquote><p>林后13:10<blockquote><p>This is why I write these things when I am absent, that when I come I may not have to be harsh in my use of authority–the authority the Lord gave me for building you up, not for tearing you down.<p>所以我不在你们那里的时候，把这话写给你们，好叫我见你们的时候，不用照主所给我的权柄，严厉的待你们。这权柄原是为造就人，并不是为败坏人。</blockquote><p>林后13:11<blockquote><p>Finally, brothers, good-by. Aim for perfection, listen to my appeal, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.<p>还有未了的话，愿弟兄们都喜乐。要作完全人。要受安慰。要同心合意。要彼此和睦。如此仁爱和平的　神，必常与你们同在。</blockquote><p>林后13:12<blockquote><p>Greet one another with a holy kiss.<p>你们亲嘴问安。彼此务要圣洁。</blockquote><p>林后13:13<blockquote><p>All the saints send their greetings.<p>众圣徒都问你们安。</blockquote><p>林后13:14<blockquote><p>May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.<p>愿主耶稣基督的恩惠，　神的慈爱，圣灵的感动，常与你们众人同在。</blockquote></article><footer role="contentinfo"><hr/><p><small class="copyright">© Seon Zhu 2022.
