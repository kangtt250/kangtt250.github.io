## 何西阿书第1章
何1:1
> The word of the LORD that came to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the reign of Jeroboam son of Jehoash king of Israel:
>
> 当乌西雅、约坦、亚哈斯、希西家作犹大王，约阿施的儿子耶罗波安作以色列王的时候，耶和华的话临到备利的儿子何西阿。


何1:2
> When the LORD began to speak through Hosea, the LORD said to him, "Go, take to yourself an adulterous wife and children of unfaithfulness, because the land is guilty of the vilest adultery in departing from the LORD."
>
> 耶和华初次与何西阿说话，对他说：“你去娶淫妇为妻，也收那从淫乱所生的儿女；因为这地大行淫乱，离弃耶和华。”


何1:3
> So he married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.
>
> 于是，何西阿去娶了滴拉音的女儿歌蔑。这妇人怀孕，给他生了一个儿子。


何1:4
> Then the LORD said to Hosea, "Call him Jezreel, because I will soon punish the house of Jehu for the massacre at Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel.
>
> 耶和华对何西阿说：“给他起名叫耶斯列；因为再过片时，我必讨耶户家在耶斯列杀人流血的罪，也必使以色列家的国灭绝。


何1:5
> In that day I will break Israel's bow in the Valley of Jezreel."
>
> 到那日，我必在耶斯列平原折断以色列的弓。”


何1:6
> Gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. Then the LORD said to Hosea, "Call her Lo-Ruhamah, for I will no longer show love to the house of Israel, that I should at all forgive them.
>
> 歌篾又怀孕生了一个女儿，耶和华对何西阿说：“给她起名叫罗路哈玛（就是“不蒙怜悯”的意思）；因为我必不再怜悯以色列家，决不赦免他们。


何1:7
> Yet I will show love to the house of Judah; and I will save them--not by bow, sword or battle, or by horses and horsemen, but by the LORD their God."
>
> 我却要怜悯犹大家，使他们靠耶和华他们的　神得救，不使他们靠弓、刀、争战、马匹与马兵得救。”


何1:8
> After she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, Gomer had another son.
>
> 歌篾给罗路哈玛断奶以后，又怀孕生了一个儿子。


何1:9
> Then the LORD said, "Call him Lo-Ammi, for you are not my people, and I am not your God.
>
> 耶和华说：“给他起名叫罗阿米（就是“非我民”的意思）；因为你们不作我的子民，我也不作你们的　神。


何1:10
> "Yet the Israelites will be like the sand on the seashore, which cannot be measured or counted. In the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' they will be called 'sons of the living God.'
>
> 然而，以色列的人数必如海沙，不可量，不可数。从前在什么地方对他们说：‘你们不是我的子民’，将来在那里必对他们说：‘你们是永生　神的儿子。’


何1:11
> The people of Judah and the people of Israel will be reunited, and they will appoint one leader and will come up out of the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel.
>
> 犹大人和以色列人必一同聚集，为自己立一个首领，从这地上去（或作“从被掳之地上来”），因为耶斯列的日子必为大日。

> "Rebuke your mother, rebuke her, for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband. Let her remove the adulterous look from her face and the unfaithfulness from between her breasts.
>
> 你们要与你们的母亲大大争辩，因为她不是我的妻子，我也不是她的丈夫。叫她除掉脸上的淫像和胸间的淫态，


何2:3
> Otherwise I will strip her naked and make her as bare as on the day she was born; I will make her like a desert, turn her into a parched land, and slay her with thirst.
>
> 免得我剥她的衣服，使她赤体与才生的时候一样；使她如旷野，如干旱之地，因渴而死。


何2:4
> I will not show my love to her children, because they are the children of adultery.
>
> 我必不怜悯她的儿女，因为他们是从淫乱而生的。


何2:5
> Their mother has been unfaithful and has conceived them in disgrace. She said, 'I will go after my lovers, who give me my food and my water, my wool and my linen, my oil and my drink.'
>
> 他们的母亲行了淫乱，怀他们的母做了可羞耻的事，因为她说：‘我要随从所爱的，我的饼、水、羊毛、麻、油、酒都是他们给的。’


何2:6
> Therefore I will block her path with thornbushes; I will wall her in so that she cannot find her way.
>
> 因此，我必用荆棘堵塞她的道，筑墙挡住她，使她找不着路。


何2:7
> She will chase after her lovers but not catch them; she will look for them but not find them. Then she will say, 'I will go back to my husband as at first, for then I was better off than now.'
>
> 她必追随所爱的，却追不上；她必寻找他们，却寻不见。便说：‘我要归回前夫，因我那时的光景比如今还好。’


何2:8
> She has not acknowledged that I was the one who gave her the grain, the new wine and oil, who lavished on her the silver and gold--which they used for Baal.
>
> 她不知道是我给她五谷、新酒和油，又加增她的金银，她却以此供奉（或作“制造”）巴力。


何2:9
> "Therefore I will take away my grain when it ripens, and my new wine when it is ready. I will take back my wool and my linen, intended to cover her nakedness.
>
> 因此，到了收割的日子，出酒的时候，我必将我的五谷、新酒收回，也必将她应当遮体的羊毛和麻夺回来。


何2:10
> So now I will expose her lewdness before the eyes of her lovers; no one will take her out of my hands.
>
> 如今我必在她所爱的眼前显露她的丑态，必无人能救她脱离我的手。


何2:11
> I will stop all her celebrations: her yearly festivals, her New Moons, her Sabbath days--all her appointed feasts.
>
> 我也必使她的宴乐、节期、月朔、安息日，并她的一切大会，都止息了。


何2:12
> I will ruin her vines and her fig trees, which she said were her pay from her lovers; I will make them a thicket, and wild animals will devour them.
>
> 我也必毁坏她的葡萄树和无花果树，就是她说‘这是我所爱的给我为赏赐’的。我必使这些树变为荒林，为田野的走兽所吃。


何2:13
> I will punish her for the days she burned incense to the Baals; she decked herself with rings and jewelry, and went after her lovers, but me she forgot," declares the LORD.
>
> 我必追讨她素日给诸巴力烧香的罪，那时她佩带耳环和别样妆饰，随从她所爱的，却忘记我。”这是耶和华说的。


何2:14
> "Therefore I am now going to allure her; I will lead her into the desert and speak tenderly to her.
>
> “后来我必劝导她，领她到旷野，对她说安慰的话。


何2:15
> There I will give her back her vineyards, and will make the Valley of Achor a door of hope. There she will sing as in the days of her youth, as in the day she came up out of Egypt.
>
> 她从那里出来，我必赐她葡萄园，又赐她亚割谷作为指望的门。她必在那里应声（或作“歌唱”），与幼年的日子一样，与从埃及地上来的时候相同。”


何2:16
> "In that day," declares the LORD, "you will call me 'my husband'; you will no longer call me 'my master.'
>
> 耶和华说：“那日你必称呼我伊施（就是“我夫”的意思），不再称呼我巴力（就是“我主”的意思）。


何2:17
> I will remove the names of the Baals from her lips; no longer will their names be invoked.
>
> 因为我必从我民的口中除掉诸巴力的名号，这名号不再提起。


何2:18
> In that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the creatures that move along the ground. Bow and sword and battle I will abolish from the land, so that all may lie down in safety.
>
> 当那日，我必为我的民与田野的走兽和空中的飞鸟，并地上的昆虫立约。又必在国中折断弓刀，止息争战，使他们安然躺卧。


何2:19
> I will betroth you to me forever; I will betroth you in righteousness and justice, in love and compassion.
>

何2:20
> I will betroth you in faithfulness, and you will acknowledge the LORD.
>
> 也以诚实聘你归我，你就必认识我耶和华。”


何2:21
> "In that day I will respond," declares the LORD--"I will respond to the skies, and they will respond to the earth;
>
> 耶和华说：“那日我必应允，我必应允天，天必应允地；


何2:22
> and the earth will respond to the grain, the new wine and oil, and they will respond to Jezreel.
>
> 地必应允五谷、新酒和油，这些必应允耶斯列民（“耶斯列”就是“　神栽种的”意思）。


何2:23
> I will plant her for myself in the land; I will show my love to the one I called 'Not my loved one.' I will say to those called 'Not my people,' 'You are my people'; and they will say, 'You are my God.'"
>
> 我必将他种在这地。素不蒙怜悯的，我必怜悯；本非我民的，我必对他说：‘你是我的民。’他必说：‘你是我的　神。’”


## 何西阿书第3章
何3:1
> The LORD said to me, "Go, show your love to your wife again, though she is loved by another and is an adulteress. Love her as the LORD loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes."
>
> 耶和华对我说：“你再去爱一个淫妇，就是她情人所爱的；好像以色列人，虽然偏向别　神，喜爱葡萄饼，耶和华还是爱他们。”


何3:2
> So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and about a homer and a lethek of barley.
>
> 我便用银子十五舍客勒，大麦一贺梅珥半，买她归我。


何3:3

>
> 以色列人也必多日独居，无君王、无首领、无祭祀、无柱像、无以弗得、无家中的神像。

>
> 但起假誓、不践前言、杀害、偷盗、奸淫、行强暴、杀人流血，接连不断。

>
> 因此，这地悲哀，其上的民、田野的兽、空中的鸟必都衰微，海中的鱼也必消灭。


何4:4
> "But let no man bring a charge, let no man accuse another, for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest.
>
> 然而，人都不必争辩，也不必指责，因为这民与抗拒祭司的人一样。


何4:5
> You stumble day and night, and the prophets stumble with you. So I will destroy your mother--
>
> 你这祭司必日间跌倒；先知也必夜间与你一同跌倒。我必灭绝你的母亲。

>
> 我的民因无知识而灭亡。你弃掉知识，我也必弃掉你，使你不再给我作祭司；你既忘了你　神的律法，我也必忘记你的儿女。

> "I will not punish your daughters when they turn to prostitution, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, because the men themselves consort with harlots and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes--a people without understanding will come to ruin!
>
> 你们的女儿淫乱，你们的新妇行淫，我却不惩罚她们，因为你们自己离群与娼妓同居，与妓女一同献祭。这无知的民必致倾倒！

>
> 以色列啊，你虽然行淫，犹大却不可犯罪。不要往吉甲去，不要上到伯亚文，也不要指着永生的耶和华起誓。


何4:16
> The Israelites are stubborn, like a stubborn heifer. How then can the LORD pasture them like lambs in a meadow?
>
> 以色列倔强，犹如倔强的母牛；现在耶和华要放他们，如同放羊羔在宽阔之地。


何4:17
