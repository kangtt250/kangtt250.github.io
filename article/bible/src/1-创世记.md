>
> 那人说：“你所赐给我、与我同居的女人，她把那树上的果子给我，我就吃了。”

> Jacob answered Laban, "I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force.
>
> 雅各回答拉班说：“恐怕你把你的女儿从我夺去，所以我逃跑。


创31:32
> But if you find anyone who has your gods, he shall not live. In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me; and if so, take it." Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods.
>
> 至于你的神像，你在谁那里搜出来，就不容谁存活，当着我们的众弟兄你认一认，在我这里有什么东西是你的，就拿去。”原来雅各不知道拉结偷了那些神像。


创31:33
> So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent and into the tent of the two maidservants, but he found nothing. After he came out of Leah's tent, he entered Rachel's tent.
>
> 拉班进了雅各、利亚并两个使女的帐棚，都没有搜出来，就从利亚的帐棚出来，进了拉结的帐棚。


创31:34

>
> 拉结已经把神像藏在骆驼的驮篓里，便坐在上头。拉班摸遍了那帐棚，并没有摸着。


创31:35
> Rachel said to her father, "Don't be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I'm having my period." So he searched but could not find the household gods.
>
> 拉结对她父亲说：“现在我身上不便，不能在你面前起来，求我主不要生气。”这样，拉班搜寻神像，竟没有搜出来。


创31:36
> Jacob was angry and took Laban to task. "What is my crime?" he asked Laban. "What sin have I committed that you hunt me down?
>
> 雅各就发怒斥责拉班说：“我有什么过犯，有什么罪恶，你竟这样火速地追我？


创31:37
> Now that you have searched through all my goods, what have you found that belongs to your household? Put it here in front of your relatives and mine, and let them judge between the two of us.
>
> 你摸遍了我一切的家具，你搜出什么来呢？可以放在你我弟兄面前，叫他们在你我中间辨别辨别。


创31:38
> "I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks.

> 我在你家这二十年，你的母绵羊、母山羊没有掉过胎。你群中的公羊，我没有吃过；


创31:39
> I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night.
>
> 被野兽撕裂的，我没有带来给你，是我自己赔上。无论是白日，是黑夜，被偷去的，你都向我索要。


创31:40
> This was my situation: The heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night, and sleep fled from my eyes.
>
> 我白日受尽干热，黑夜受尽寒霜，不得合眼睡着，我常是这样。


创31:41
> It was like this for the twenty years I was in your household. I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, and you changed my wages ten times.
>
> 我这二十年在你家里，为你的两个女儿服事你十四年，为你的羊群服事你六年，你又十次改了我的工价。


创31:42
> If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would surely have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked you."
>
> 若不是我父亲以撒所敬畏的　神，就是亚伯拉罕的　神与我同在，你如今必定打发我空手而去。　神看见我的苦情和我的劳碌，就在昨夜责备你。”


创31:43
> Laban answered Jacob, "The women are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. All you see is mine. Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about the children they have borne?
>
> 拉班回答雅各说：“这女儿是我的女儿，这些孩子是我的孩子，这些羊群也是我的羊群；凡在你眼前的都是我的。我的女儿并她们所生的孩子，我今日能向他们作什么呢？


创31:44
> Come now, let's make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between us."

创31:47
> Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed.
>
> 拉班称那石堆为伊迦尔撒哈杜他，雅各却称那石堆为迦累得（都是“以石堆为证”的意思）。


创31:48
> Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me today." That is why it was called Galeed.
>
> 拉班说：“今日这石堆作你我中间的证据。”因此这地方名叫迦累得，


创31:49
> It was also called Mizpah, because he said, "May the LORD keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other.
>
> 又叫米斯巴，意思说：“我们彼此离别以后，愿耶和华在你我中间鉴察。


创31:50
> If you mistreat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters, even though no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me."
>
> 你若苦待我的女儿，又在我的女儿以外另娶妻，虽没有人知道，却有　神在你我中间作见证。”


创31:51
> Laban also said to Jacob, "Here is this heap, and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me.
>
> 拉班又说：“你看我在你我中间所立的这石堆和柱子。


创31:52
> This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me.
>
> 这石堆作证据，这柱子也作证据。我必不过这石堆去害你；你也不可过这石堆和柱子来害我。


创31:53
> May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." So Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac.
>
> 但愿亚伯拉罕的　神和拿鹤的　神，就是他们父亲的　神，在你我中间判断。”雅各就指着他父亲以撒所敬畏的　神起誓，


创31:54
> He offered a sacrifice there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night there.
>

>
> 雅各打发人先往西珥地去，就是以东地，见他哥哥以扫，


创32:4
> He instructed them: "This is what you are to say to my master Esau: 'Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now.
>
> 吩咐他们说：“你们对我主以扫说：‘你的仆人雅各这样说，我在拉班那里寄居，直到如今。


创32:5
> I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, menservants and maidservants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.'"
>
> 我有牛、驴、羊群、仆婢，现在打发人来报告我主，为要在你眼前蒙恩。’”


创32:6
> When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, "We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him."

>
> 雅各就甚惧怕，而且愁烦，便把那与他同在的人口和羊群、牛群、骆驼分作两队，


创32:8
> He thought, "If Esau comes and attacks one group, the group that is left may escape."
>
> 说：“以扫若来击杀这一队，剩下的那一队还可以逃避。”


创32:9
> Then Jacob prayed, "O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who said to me, 'Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,'
>
> 雅各说：“耶和华我祖亚伯拉罕的　神，我父亲以撒的　神啊，你曾对我说：‘回你本地本族去，我要厚待你。’


创32:10
> I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two groups.
>
> 你向仆人所施的一切慈爱和诚实，我一点也不配得。我先前只拿着我的杖过这约旦河，如今我却成了两队了。


创32:11
> Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children.
>
> 求你救我脱离我哥哥以扫的手，因为我怕他来杀我，连妻子带儿女一同杀了。

> 你曾说：‘我必定厚待你，使你的后裔如同海边的沙，多得不可胜数。’”


创32:13

创32:16
> He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, "Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds."
>
> 每样各分一群，交在仆人手下，就对仆人说：“你们要在我前头过去，使群群相离，有空闲的地方。”


创32:17
> He instructed the one in the lead: "When my brother Esau meets you and asks, 'To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?'
>
> 又吩咐尽先走的说：“我哥哥以扫遇见你的时候，问你说：‘你是哪家的人？要往哪里去？你前头这些是谁的？’


创32:18
> then you are to say, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.'"
>
> 你就说：‘是你仆人雅各的，是送给我主以扫的礼物，他自己也在我们后边。’”


创32:19
> He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: "You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.
>
> 又吩咐第二、第三和一切赶群畜的人说：“你们遇见以扫的时候，也要这样对他说。


创32:20
> And be sure to say, 'Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.'" For he thought, "I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me."
>
> 并且你们要说：‘你仆人雅各在我们后边。’”因雅各心里说：“我借着在我前头去的礼物解他的恨，然后再见他的面，或者他容纳我。”


创32:21
> So Jacob's gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.
>
> 于是礼物先过去了。那夜，雅各在队中住宿。

> 先打发他们过河，又打发所有的都过去，


创32:24
> So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak.

> 只剩下雅各一人。有一个人来和他摔跤，直到黎明。


创32:25
> When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob's hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.
>
> 那人见自己胜不过他，就将他的大腿窝摸了一把，雅各的大腿窝正在摔跤的时候就扭了。


创32:26
> Then the man said, "Let me go, for it is daybreak." But Jacob replied, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."
>
> 那人说：“天黎明了，容我去吧！”雅各说：“你不给我祝福，我就不容你去。”


创32:27
> The man asked him, "What is your name?" "Jacob," he answered.
>
> 那人说：“你名叫什么？”他说：“我名叫雅各。”


创32:28
> Then the man said, "Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men and have overcome."
>
> 那人说：“你的名不要再叫雅各，要叫以色列，因为你与　神与人较力，都得了胜。”


创32:29
> Jacob said, "Please tell me your name." But he replied, "Why do you ask my name?" Then he blessed him there.
>
> 雅各问他说：“请将你的名告诉我。”那人说：“何必问我的名？”于是在那里给雅各祝福。


创32:30
> So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, "It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared."
>
> 雅各便给那地方起名叫毗努伊勒（就是“　神之面”的意思），意思说：“我面对面见了　神，我的性命仍得保全。”


创32:31
> The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip.
>
> 日头刚出来的时候，雅各经过毗努伊勒，他的大腿就瘸了。


创32:32
> Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob's hip was touched near the tendon.
>
> 故此，以色列人不吃大腿窝的筋，直到今日，因为那人摸了雅各大腿窝的筋。

创33:8
> Esau asked, "What do you mean by all these droves I met?" "To find favor in your eyes, my lord," he said.

> 以扫说：“我所遇见的这些群畜是什么意思呢？”雅各说：“是要在我主面前蒙恩的。”


创33:9
> But Esau said, "I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself."
>
> 以扫说：“兄弟啊，我的已经够了，你的仍归你吧！”


创33:10
> "No, please!" said Jacob. "If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably.
>
> 雅各说：“不然，我若在你眼前蒙恩，就求你从我手里收下这礼物，因为我见了你的面，如同见了　神的面，并且你容纳了我。


创33:11
> Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need." And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it.
>
> 求你收下我带来给你的礼物，因为　神恩待我，使我充足。”雅各再三地求他，他才收下了。


创33:12
> Then Esau said, "Let us be on our way; I'll accompany you."
>
> 以扫说：“我们可以起身前往，我在你前头走。”


创33:13
> But Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die.
>
> 雅各对他说：“我主知道孩子们年幼娇嫩，牛羊也正在乳养的时候，若是催赶一天，群畜都必死了。


创33:14

创33:15
> Esau said, "Then let me leave some of my men with you." "But why do that?" Jacob asked. "Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord."
