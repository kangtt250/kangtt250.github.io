When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him honor.<p>第三天，有一人从扫罗的营里出来，衣服撕裂，头蒙灰尘，到大卫面前伏地叩拜。</blockquote><p>撒下1:3<blockquote><p>“Where have you come from?” David asked him. He answered, “I have escaped from the Israelite camp.”<p>大卫问他说：“你从哪里来？”他说：“我从以色列的营里逃来。”</blockquote><p>撒下1:4<blockquote><p>“What happened?” David asked. “Tell me.” He said, “The men fled from the battle. Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.”<p>大卫又问他说：“事情怎样？请你告诉我。”他回答说：“百姓从阵上逃跑，也有许多人仆倒死亡，扫罗和他儿子约拿单也死了。”</blockquote><p>撒下1:5<blockquote><p>Then David said to the young man who brought him the report, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”<p>大卫问报信的少年人说：“你怎么知道扫罗和他儿子约拿单死了呢？”</blockquote><p>撒下1:6<blockquote><p>“I happened to be on Mount Gilboa,” the young man said, “and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and riders almost upon him.<p>报信的少年人说：“我偶然到基利波山，看见扫罗伏在自己枪上，有战车，马兵紧紧地追他。</blockquote><p>撒下1:7<blockquote><p>When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, and I said, ‘What can I do?’<p>他回头看见我，就呼叫我。我说：‘我在这里。’</blockquote><p>撒下1:8<blockquote><p>“He asked me, ‘Who are you?’ “‘An Amalekite,’ I answered.<p>他问我说：‘你是什么人？’我说：‘我是亚玛力人。’</blockquote><p>撒下1:9<blockquote><p>“Then he said to me, ‘Stand over me and kill me! I am in the throes of death, but I’m still alive.’<p>他说：‘请你来将我杀死，因为痛苦抓住我，我的生命尚存。’</blockquote><p>撒下1:10<blockquote><p>“So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band on his arm and have brought them here to my lord.”<p>我准知他仆倒必不能活，就去将他杀死，把他头上的冠冕，臂上的镯子拿到我主这里。”</blockquote><p>撒下1:11<blockquote><p>Then David and all the men with him took hold of their clothes and tore them.<p>大卫就撕裂衣服，跟随他的人也是如此。</blockquote><p>撒下1:12<blockquote><p>They mourned and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the army of the LORD and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.<p>而且悲哀，哭号禁食到晚上，是因扫罗和他儿子约拿单，并耶和华的民以色列家的人倒在刀下。</blockquote><p>撒下1:13<blockquote><p>David said to the young man who brought him the report, “Where are you from?” “I am the son of an alien, an Amalekite,” he answered.<p>大卫问报信的少年人说：“你是哪里的人？”他说：“我是亚玛力客人的儿子。”</blockquote><p>撒下1:14<blockquote><p>David asked him, “Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD’S anointed?”<p>大卫说：“你伸手杀害耶和华的受膏者，怎么不畏惧呢？”</blockquote><p>撒下1:15<blockquote><p>Then David called one of his men and said, “Go, strike him down!” So he struck him down, and he died.<p>大卫叫了一个少年人来，说：“你去杀他吧！”</blockquote><p>撒下1:16<blockquote><p>For David had said to him, “Your blood be on your own head. Your own mouth testified against you when you said, ‘I killed the LORD’S anointed.’”<p>大卫对他说：“你流人血的罪归到自己的头上，因为你亲口作见证说：‘我杀了耶和华的受膏者。’”少年人就把他杀了。</blockquote><p>撒下1:17<blockquote><p>David took up this lament concerning Saul and his son Jonathan,<p>大卫作哀歌，吊扫罗和他儿子约拿单，</blockquote><p>撒下1:18<blockquote><p>and ordered that the men of Judah be taught this lament of the bow (it is written in the Book of Jashar):<p>且吩咐将这歌教导犹大人。这歌名叫弓歌，写在雅煞珥书上。</blockquote><p>撒下1:19<blockquote><p>“Your glory, O Israel, lies slain on your heights. How the mighty have fallen!<p>歌中说：“以色列啊，你尊荣者在山上被杀。大英雄何竟死亡！</blockquote><p>撒下1:20<blockquote><p>“Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines be glad, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice.<p>不要在迦特报告，不要在亚实基伦街上传扬；免得非利士的女子欢乐，免得未受割礼之人的女子矜夸。</blockquote><p>撒下1:21<blockquote><p>“O mountains of Gilboa, may you have neither dew nor rain, nor fields that yield offerings of grain. For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul–no longer rubbed with oil.<p>基利波山哪，愿你那里没有雨露，愿你田地无土产可作供物！因为英雄的盾牌，在那里被污丢弃。扫罗的盾牌，仿佛未曾抹油。</blockquote><p>撒下1:22<blockquote><p>From the blood of the slain, from the flesh of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, the sword of Saul did not return unsatisfied.<p>约拿单的弓箭，非流敌人的血不退缩；扫罗的刀剑，非剖勇士的油不收回。</blockquote><p>撒下1:23<blockquote><p>“Saul and Jonathan–in life they were loved and gracious, and in death they were not parted. They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.<p>扫罗和约拿单，活时相悦相爱，死时也不分离。他们比鹰更快，比狮子还强。</blockquote><p>撒下1:24<blockquote><p>“O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and finery, who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold.<p>以色列的女子啊，当为扫罗哭号！他曾使你们穿朱红色的美衣，使你们衣服有黄金的妆饰。</blockquote><p>撒下1:25<blockquote><p>“How the mighty have fallen in battle! Jonathan lies slain on your heights.<p>英雄何竟在阵上仆倒！约拿单何竟在山上被杀！</blockquote><p>撒下1:26<blockquote><p>I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; you were very dear to me. Your love for me was wonderful, more wonderful than that of women.<p>我兄约拿单哪，我为你悲伤！我甚喜悦你！你向我发的爱情奇妙非常，过于妇女的爱情。</blockquote><p>撒下1:27<blockquote><p>“How the mighty have fallen! The weapons of war have perished!”<p>英雄何竟仆倒！战具何竟灭没！”</blockquote><h2 id="撒母耳记下第2章">撒母耳记下第2章</h2><p>撒下2:1<blockquote><p>In the course of time, David inquired of the LORD. “Shall I go up to one of the towns of Judah?” he asked. The LORD said, “Go up.” David asked, “Where shall I go?” “To Hebron,” the LORD answered.<p>此后，大卫问耶和华说：“我上犹大的一个城去可以吗？”耶和华说：“可以。”大卫说：“我上哪一个城去呢？”耶和华说：“上希伯仑去。”</blockquote><p>撒下2:2<blockquote><p>So David went up there with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel.<p>于是，大卫和他的两个妻：一个是耶斯列人亚希暖，一个是作过迦密人拿八妻的亚比该，都上那里去了。</blockquote><p>撒下2:3<blockquote><p>David also took the men who were with him, each with his family, and they settled in Hebron and its towns.<p>大卫也将跟随他的人和他们各人的眷属一同带上去，住在希伯仑的城邑中。</blockquote><p>撒下2:4<blockquote><p>Then the men of Judah came to Hebron and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. When David was told that it was the men of Jabesh Gilead who had buried Saul,<p>犹大人来到希伯仑，在那里膏大卫作犹大家的王。有人告诉大卫说：“葬埋扫罗的是基列雅比人。”</blockquote><p>撒下2:5<blockquote><p>he sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead to say to them, “The LORD bless you for showing this kindness to Saul your master by burying him.<p>大卫就差人去见基列雅比人，对他们说：“你们厚待你们的主扫罗，将他葬埋。愿耶和华赐福与你们。</blockquote><p>撒下2:6<blockquote><p>May the LORD now show you kindness and faithfulness, and I too will show you the same favor because you have done this.<p>你们既行了这事，愿耶和华以慈爱诚实待你们，我也要为此厚待你们。</blockquote><p>撒下2:7<blockquote><p>Now then, be strong and brave, for Saul your master is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.”<p>现在你们的主扫罗死了，犹大家已经膏我作他们的王，所以你们要刚强奋勇。”</blockquote><p>撒下2:8<blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ish-Bosheth son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim.<p>扫罗的元帅尼珥的儿子押尼珥，曾将扫罗的儿子伊施波设带过河到玛哈念，</blockquote><p>撒下2:9<blockquote><p>He made him king over Gilead, Ashuri and Jezreel, and also over Ephraim, Benjamin and all Israel.<p>立他作王，治理基列，亚书利，耶斯列，以法莲，便雅悯和以色列众人。</blockquote><p>撒下2:10<blockquote><p>Ish-Bosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he reigned two years. The house of Judah, however, followed David.<p>扫罗的儿子伊施波设登基的时候，年四十岁，作以色列王二年；惟独犹大家归从大卫。</blockquote><p>撒下2:11<blockquote><p>The length of time David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.<p>大卫在希伯仑作犹大家的王，共七年零六个月。</blockquote><p>撒下2:12<blockquote><p>Abner son of Ner, together with the men of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon.<p>尼珥的儿子押尼珥和扫罗的儿子伊施波设的仆人，从玛哈念出来，往基遍去。</blockquote><p>撒下2:13<blockquote><p>Joab son of Zeruiah and David’s men went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. One group sat down on one side of the pool and one group on the other side.<p>洗鲁雅的儿子约押和大卫的仆人也出来，在基遍池旁与他们相遇。一班坐在池这边，一班坐在池那边。</blockquote><p>撒下2:14<blockquote><p>Then Abner said to Joab, “Let’s have some of the young men get up and fight hand to hand in front of us.” “All right, let them do it,” Joab said.<p>押尼珥对约押说：“让少年人起来，在我们面前戏耍吧！”约押说：“可以。”</blockquote><p>撒下2:15<blockquote><p>So they stood up and were counted off–twelve men for Benjamin and Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve for David.<p>就按着定数起来：属扫罗儿子伊施波设的便雅悯人过去十二名，大卫的仆人也过去十二名。</blockquote><p>撒下2:16<blockquote><p>Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his dagger into his opponent’s side, and they fell down together. So that place in Gibeon was called Helkath Hazzurim.<p>彼此揪头，用刀刺肋，一同仆倒。所以那地叫作希利甲哈素林，就在基遍。</blockquote><p>撒下2:17<blockquote><p>The battle that day was very fierce, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by David’s men.<p>那日的战事凶猛，押尼珥和以色列人败在大卫的仆人面前。</blockquote><p>撒下2:18<blockquote><p>The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai and Asahel. Now Asahel was as fleet-footed as a wild gazelle.<p>在那里有洗鲁雅的三个儿子：约押，亚比筛，亚撒黑。亚撒黑脚快如野鹿一般。</blockquote><p>撒下2:19<blockquote><p>He chased Abner, turning neither to the right nor to the left as he pursued him.<p>亚撒黑追赶押尼珥，直追赶他不偏左右。</blockquote><p>撒下2:20<blockquote><p>Abner looked behind him and asked, “Is that you, Asahel?” “It is,” he answered.<p>押尼珥回头说：“你是亚撒黑吗？”回答说：“是。”</blockquote><p>撒下2:21<blockquote><p>Then Abner said to him, “Turn aside to the right or to the left; take on one of the young men and strip him of his weapons.” But Asahel would not stop chasing him.<p>押尼珥对他说：“你或转向左，转向右，拿住一个少年人，剥去他的战衣。”亚撒黑却不肯转开不追赶他。</blockquote><p>撒下2:22<blockquote><p>Again Abner warned Asahel, “Stop chasing me! Why should I strike you down? How could I look your brother Joab in the face?”<p>押尼珥又对亚撒黑说：“你转开不追赶我吧！我何必杀你呢？若杀你，有什么脸见你哥哥约押呢？”</blockquote><p>撒下2:23<blockquote><p>But Asahel refused to give up the pursuit; so Abner thrust the butt of his spear into Asahel’s stomach, and the spear came out through his back. He fell there and died on the spot. And every man stopped when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died.<p>亚撒黑仍不肯转开，故此押尼珥就用枪尾刺入他的肚腹，甚至枪从背后透出。亚撒黑就在那里仆倒而死。众人赶到亚撒黑仆倒而死的地方，就都站住。</blockquote><p>撒下2:24<blockquote><p>But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and as the sun was setting, they came to the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the way to the wasteland of Gibeon.<p>约押和亚比筛追赶押尼珥，日落的时候，到了通基遍旷野的路旁，基亚对面的亚玛山。</blockquote><p>撒下2:25<blockquote><p>Then the men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner. They formed themselves into a group and took their stand on top of a hill.<p>便雅悯人聚集，跟随押尼珥站在一个山顶上。</blockquote><p>撒下2:26<blockquote><p>Abner called out to Joab, “Must the sword devour forever? Don’t you realize that this will end in bitterness? How long before you order your men to stop pursuing their brothers?”<p>押尼珥呼叫约押说：“刀剑岂可永远杀人吗？你岂不知终久必有苦楚吗？你要等何时才叫百姓回去，不追赶弟兄呢？”</blockquote><p>撒下2:27<blockquote><p>Joab answered, “As surely as God lives, if you had not spoken, the men would have continued the pursuit of their brothers until morning.”<p>约押说：“我指着永生的　神起誓，你若不说戏耍的那句话，今日早晨百姓就回去，不追赶弟兄了。”</blockquote><p>撒下2:28<blockquote><p>So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the men came to a halt; they no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight anymore.<p>于是约押吹角，众民就站住，不再追赶以色列人，也不再打仗了。</blockquote><p>撒下2:29<blockquote><p>All that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, continued through the whole Bithron and came to Mahanaim.<p>押尼珥和跟随他的人整夜经过亚拉巴，过约旦河走过毕伦，到了玛哈念。</blockquote><p>撒下2:30<blockquote><p>Then Joab returned from pursuing Abner and assembled all his men. Besides Asahel, nineteen of David’s men were found missing.<p>约押追赶押尼珥回来，聚集众民，见大卫的仆人中缺少了十九个人和亚撒黑。</blockquote><p>撒下2:31<blockquote><p>But David’s men had killed three hundred and sixty Benjamites who were with Abner.<p>但大卫的仆人杀了便雅悯人和跟随押尼珥的人，共三百六十名。</blockquote><p>撒下2:32<blockquote><p>They took Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb at Bethlehem.

Go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.<p>所以押沙龙对仆人说：“你们看，约押有一块田，与我的田相近，其中有大麦，你们去放火烧了。”押沙龙的仆人就去放火烧了那田。</blockquote><p>撒下14:31<blockquote><p>Then Joab did go to Absalom’s house and he said to him, “Why have your servants set my field on fire?”<p>于是约押起来，到了押沙龙家里，问他说：“你的仆人为何放火烧了我的田呢？”</blockquote><p>撒下14:32<blockquote><p>Absalom said to Joab, “Look, I sent word to you and said, ‘Come here so I can send you to the king to ask, “Why have I come from Geshur?

I will not sacrifice to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen and paid fifty shekels of silver for them.<p>王对亚劳拿说：“不然，我必要按着价值向你买，我不肯用白得之物作燔祭，献给耶和华我的　神。”大卫就用五十舍客勒银子买了那禾场与牛。</blockquote><p>撒下24:25<blockquote><p>David built an altar to the LORD there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then the LORD answered prayer in behalf of the land, and the plague on Israel was stopped.<p>大卫在那里为耶和华筑了一座坛，献燔祭和平安祭。如此，耶和华垂听国民所求的，瘟疫在以色列人中就止住了。</blockquote></article><footer role="contentinfo"><hr/><p><small class="copyright">© Seon Zhu 2022.
