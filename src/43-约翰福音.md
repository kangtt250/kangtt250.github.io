约1:7
> He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe.
>
> 这人来，为要作见证，就是为光作见证，叫众人因他可以信。

>
> 道成了肉身，住在我们中间，充充满满地有恩典，有真理。我们也见过他的荣光，正是父独生子的荣光。


约1:15

>
> 约翰为他作见证，喊着说：“这就是我曾说：‘那在我以后来的，反成了在我以前的，因他本来在我以前。’”


约1:16
> From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another.

>
> 约翰所作的见证记在下面：犹太人从耶路撒冷差祭司和利未人到约翰那里，问他说：“你是谁？”


约1:20
> He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, "I am not the Christ."
>
> 他就明说，并不隐瞒；明说：“我不是基督。”

>
> 他们又问他说：“这样，你是谁呢？是以利亚吗？”他说：“我不是。”“是那先知吗？”他回答说：“不是。”


约1:22
> Finally they said, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"
>
> 于是他们说：“你到底是谁？叫我们好回覆差我们来的人。你自己说，你是谁？”


约1:23

约1:24
> Now some Pharisees who had been sent
>
> 那些人是法利赛人差来的（或作“那差来的是法利赛人”）。


约1:25
> questioned him, "Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"
>
> 他们就问他说：“你既不是基督，不是以利亚，也不是那先知，为什么施洗呢？”


约1:26
> "I baptize with water," John replied, "but among you stands one you do not know.
>
> 约翰回答说：“我是用水施洗，但有一位站在你们中间，是你们不认识的，


约1:27
> He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie."

>
> 次日，约翰看见耶稣来到他那里，就说：“看哪，　神的羔羊，除去（或作“背负”）世人罪孽的。


约1:30
> This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'
>
> 这就是我曾说‘有一位在我以后来，反成了在我以前的，因他本来在我以前。’


约1:31
> I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel."
>
> 我先前不认识他，如今我来用水施洗，为要叫他显明给以色列人。”


约1:32
> Then John gave this testimony: "I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.
>
> 约翰又作见证说：“我曾看见圣灵仿佛鸽子从天降下，住在他的身上。


约1:33
> I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.'
>
> 我先前不认识他，只是那差我来用水施洗的，对我说：‘你看见圣灵降下来，住在谁的身上，谁就是用圣灵施洗的。’


约1:34

约1:39
> "Come," he replied, "and you will see." So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour.
>
> 耶稣说：“你们来看。”他们就去看他在哪里住，这一天便与他同住。那时约有申正了。

> 他先找着自己的哥哥西门，对他说：“我们遇见弥赛亚了（“弥赛亚”翻出来就是“基督”）！”


约1:42
> And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas" (which, when translated, is Peter).
>
> 于是领他去见耶稣。耶稣看着他说：“你是约翰的儿子西门（“约翰”马太16章17节称“约拿”），你要称为矶法（“矶法”翻出来就是“彼得”）。”


约1:43
> The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, "Follow me."

>
> 腓力找着拿但业，对他说：“摩西在律法上所写的和众先知所记的那一位，我们遇见了，就是约瑟的儿子拿撒勒人耶稣。”


约1:46
> "Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?" Nathanael asked. "Come and see," said Philip.
>
> 拿但业对他说：“拿撒勒还能出什么好的吗？”腓力说：“你来看！”


约1:47
> When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, "Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false."
>
> 耶稣看见拿但业来，就指着他说：“看哪，这是个真以色列人，他心里是没有诡诈的。”


约1:48
> "How do you know me?" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, "I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you."
>
> 拿但业对耶稣说：“你从哪里知道我呢？”耶稣回答说：“腓力还没有招呼你，你在无花果树底下，我就看见你了。”


约1:49
> Then Nathanael declared, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel."
>
> 拿但业说：“拉比，你是　神的儿子，你是以色列的王！”


约1:50
> Jesus said, "You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that."
>
> 耶稣对他说：“因为我说在无花果树底下看见你，你就信吗？你将要看见比这更大的事。”


约1:51
> He then added, "I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."
>
> 又说：“我实实在在的告诉你们，你们将要看见天开了，　神的使者上去下来在人子身上。”

>
> 耶稣回答说：“我实实在在地告诉你：人若不重生，就不能见　神的国。”


约3:4
> "How can a man be born when he is old?" Nicodemus asked. "Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!"
>
> 尼哥底母说：“人已经老了，如何能重生呢？岂能再进母腹生出来吗？”


约3:5
> Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.

约3:18
> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.
>
> 信他的人，不被定罪；不信的人，罪已经定了，因为他不信　神独生子的名。


约3:19
> This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil.
>
> 光来到世间，世人因自己的行为是恶的，不爱光倒爱黑暗，定他们的罪就是在此。


约3:20

>
> 就来见约翰说：“拉比，从前同你在约旦河外、你所见证的那位，现在施洗，众人都往他那里去了。”


约3:27
> To this John replied, "A man can receive only what is given him from heaven.
>

>
> 从天上来的，是在万有之上；从地上来的，是属乎地，他所说的也是属乎地。从天上来的是在万有之上。


约3:32
> He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony.
>
> 他将所见所闻的见证出来，只是没有人领受他的见证。


约3:33
> The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful.
>

>
> 耶稣说：“我若说得不是，你可以指证那不是；我若说得是，你为什么打我呢？”


约18:24
> Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest.
>
> 亚那就把耶稣解到大祭司该亚法那里，仍是捆着解去的。

> 彼拉多说：“你不对我说话吗？你岂不知我有权柄释放你，也有权柄把你钉十字架吗？”


约19:11
> Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin."
>
> 耶稣回答说：“若不是从上头赐给你的，你就毫无权柄办我，所以把我交给你的那人，罪更重了。”


约19:12
> From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jews kept shouting, "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar."
>
> 从此彼拉多想要释放耶稣，无奈犹太人喊着说：“你若释放这个人，就不是凯撒的忠臣（原文作“朋友”）。凡以自己为王的，就是背叛凯撒了。”

> 兵丁既然将耶稣钉在十字架上，就拿他的衣服分为四份，每兵一份；又拿他的里衣，这件里衣原来没有缝儿，是上下一片织成的。


约19:24
> "Let's not tear it," they said to one another. "Let's decide by lot who will get it." This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled which said, "They divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing." So this is what the soldiers did.
>
> 他们就彼此说：“我们不要撕开，只要拈阄，看谁得着。”这要应验经上的话说：“他们分了我的外衣，为我的里衣拈阄。”兵丁果然做了这事。


约19:25
> Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.

> When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
>
> 耶稣尝（原文作“受”）了那醋，就说：“成了！”，便低下头，将灵魂交付　神了。


约19:31
> Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.
>
> 犹太人因这日是预备日，又因那安息日是个大日，就求彼拉多叫人打断他们的腿，把他们拿去，免得尸首当安息日留在十字架上。

约19:35
> The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.
>
> 看见这事的那人就作见证，他的见证也是真的，并且他知道自己所说的是真的，叫你们也可以信。


约19:36
> These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken,"
>
> 这些事成了，为要应验经上的话说：“他的骨头一根也不可折断。”


约19:37
> and, as another scripture says, "They will look on the one they have pierced."
>
> 经上又有一句说：“他们要仰望自己所扎的人。”


约19:38
> Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jews. With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away.
