可1:24
> "What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"

>
> 对他说：“你要谨慎，什么话都不可告诉人；只要去把身体给祭司察看，又因为你洁净了，献上摩西所吩咐的礼物，对众人作证据。”


可1:45
> Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.
>
> 那人出去，倒说许多的话，把这件事传扬开了，叫耶稣以后不得再明明地进城，只好在外边旷野地方。人从各处都就了他来。

> 耶稣对他们说：“　神国的奥秘，只叫你们知道，若是对外人讲，凡事就用比喻，


可4:12
> so that, "'they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!'"
>
> 叫‘他们看是看见，却不晓得；听是听见，却不明白；恐怕他们回转过来，就得赦免。’”


可4:13
> Then Jesus said to them, "Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?
>
> 又对他们说：“你们不明白这比喻吗？这样怎能明白一切的比喻呢？


可4:14
> The farmer sows the word.
>
> 撒种之人所撒的就是道。


可4:15
> Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.

>
> 那撒在石头地上的，就是人听了道，立刻欢喜领受，


可4:17
> But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.
>
> 但他心里没有根，不过是暂时的，及至为道遭了患难，或是受了逼迫，立刻就跌倒了；


可4:18
> Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word;
>
> 还有那撒在荆棘里的，就是人听了道，


可4:19
> but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.
>
> 后来有世上的思虑，钱财的迷惑，和别样的私欲进来，把道挤住了，就不能结实；


可4:20
> Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop--thirty, sixty or even a hundred times what was sown."
>
> 那撒在好地上的，就是人听道，又领受，并且结实，有三十倍的，有六十倍的，有一百倍的。”


可4:21
> He said to them, "Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don't you put it on its stand?
>
> 耶稣又对他们说：“人拿灯来，岂是要放在斗底下，床底下，不放在灯台上吗？


可4:22

>
> 因为掩藏的事，没有不显出来的；隐瞒的事，没有不露出来的。


可4:23
> If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."
