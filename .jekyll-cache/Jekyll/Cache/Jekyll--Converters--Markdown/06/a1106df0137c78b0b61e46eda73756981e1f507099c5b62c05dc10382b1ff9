I"Ø<p>This weekâ€™s been a mixed one, in truth. It was devoted to creating a stage background for my level, one that looked
appropriate and would be easily understood by the player when they perceive it. Iâ€™ve had some small successes, and 
I now have a parallax scrolling background for my level. That being said, my severe lack of skills when it comes 
to creating digital art (as well as traditional art) has me feeling that my background could be made a lot better.</p>
