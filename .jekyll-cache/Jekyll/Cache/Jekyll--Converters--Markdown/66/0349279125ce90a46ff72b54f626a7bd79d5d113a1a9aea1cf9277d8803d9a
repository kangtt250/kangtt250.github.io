I"E<p>We dedicated the first week of the project towards documentation and design.
My task this week was to design the main character for the game.
We knew we wanted a lynx as our main character and that we wanted an aesthetic similar to games such as classic Sonic the Hedgehog and Freedom Planet.
To this end we decided to use pixel art for the game. 
I had never worked with pixel art before so this presented a fun challenge in learning a new style.
I went about finding sources and tutorials on how to do pixel art and practiced by redrawing Sonic from the game Sonic Mania.</p>
