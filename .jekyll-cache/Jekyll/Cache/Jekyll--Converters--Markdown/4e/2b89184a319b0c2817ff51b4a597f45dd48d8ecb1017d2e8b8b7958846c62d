I"	<p>This’ll be a mighty short one. Just a note on what I’ll be working on for the following week or so. After tightening
up the stage background for my level, I decided to take over from Will and start working on player movement as I 
feel I can get more work done coding rather than drawing. In the meantime, Will’ll be working on enemy sprites
while Adrian will code the behaviour for the enemies. Our goal for the moment is to get all our mechanics 
finished and integrated into one level for the time being.</p>
