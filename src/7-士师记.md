## 士师记第1章
士1:1
> After the death of Joshua, the Israelites asked the LORD, "Who will be the first to go up and fight for us against the Canaanites?"
>
> 约书亚死后，以色列人求问耶和华说：“我们中间谁当首先上去攻击迦南人，与他们争战？”


士1:2
> The LORD answered, "Judah is to go; I have given the land into their hands."
>
> 耶和华说：“犹大当先上去，我已将那地交在他手中。”


士1:3
> Then the men of Judah said to the Simeonites their brothers, "Come up with us into the territory allotted to us, to fight against the Canaanites. We in turn will go with you into yours." So the Simeonites went with them.
>
> 犹大对他哥哥西缅说：“请你同我到拈阄所得之地去，好与迦南人争战；以后我也同你到你拈阄所得之地去。”于是西缅与他同去。


士1:4
> When Judah attacked, the LORD gave the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek.
>
> 犹大就上去。耶和华将迦南人和比利洗人交在他们手中，他们在比色击杀了一万人。


士1:5
> It was there that they found Adoni-Bezek and fought against him, putting to rout the Canaanites and Perizzites.
>
> 又在那里遇见亚多尼比色，与他争战，杀败迦南人和比利洗人。


士1:6
> Adoni-Bezek fled, but they chased him and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
>
> 亚多尼比色逃跑，他们追赶，拿住他，砍断他手脚的大拇指。


士1:7
> Then Adoni-Bezek said, "Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have picked up scraps under my table. Now God has paid me back for what I did to them." They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
>
> 亚多尼比色说：“从前有七十个王，手脚的大拇指都被我砍断，在我桌子底下拾取零碎食物。现在　神按着我所行的报应我了。”于是，他们将亚多尼比色带到耶路撒冷，他就死在那里。


士1:8
> The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem also and took it. They put the city to the sword and set it on fire.
>
> 犹大人攻打耶路撒冷，将城攻取，用刀杀了城内的人，并且放火烧城。


士1:9
> After that, the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev and the western foothills.
>
> 后来犹大人下去，与住山地、南地和高原的迦南人争战。


士1:10
> They advanced against the Canaanites living in Hebron (formerly called Kiriath Arba) and defeated Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai.
>
> 犹大人去攻击住希伯仑的迦南人，杀了示筛、亚希幔、挞买。希伯仑从前名叫基列亚巴。


士1:11
> From there they advanced against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher).
>
> 他们从那里去攻击底璧的居民。底璧从前名叫基列西弗。


士1:12
> And Caleb said, "I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher."
>
> 迦勒说：“谁能攻打基列西弗，将城夺取，我就把我女儿押撒给他为妻。”


士1:13
> Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it; so Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him in marriage.
>
> 迦勒兄弟基纳斯的儿子俄陀聂夺取了那城，迦勒就把女儿押撒给他为妻。


士1:14
> One day when she came to Othniel, she urged him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, "What can I do for you?"
>
> 押撒过门的时候，劝丈夫向她父亲求一块田。押撒一下驴，迦勒问她说：“你要什么？”


士1:15
> She replied, "Do me a special favor. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water." Then Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
>
> 她说：“求你赐福给我。你既将我安置在南地，求你也给我水泉。”迦勒就把上泉下泉赐给她。


士1:16
> The descendants of Moses' father-in-law, the Kenite, went up from the City of Palms with the men of Judah to live among the people of the Desert of Judah in the Negev near Arad.
>
> 摩西的内兄（或作“岳父”）是基尼人，他的子孙与犹大人一同离了棕树城，往亚拉得以南的犹大旷野去，就住在民中。


士1:17
> Then the men of Judah went with the Simeonites their brothers and attacked the Canaanites living in Zephath, and they totally destroyed the city. Therefore it was called Hormah.
>
> 犹大和他哥哥西缅同去，击杀了住洗法的迦南人，将城尽行毁灭，那城的名便叫何珥玛。


士1:18
> The men of Judah also took Gaza, Ashkelon and Ekron--each city with its territory.
>
> 犹大又取了迦萨和迦萨的四境，亚实基伦和亚实基伦的四境，以革伦和以革伦的四境。


士1:19
> The LORD was with the men of Judah. They took possession of the hill country, but they were unable to drive the people from the plains, because they had iron chariots.
>
> 耶和华与犹大同在，犹大就赶出山地的居民，只是不能赶出平原的居民，因为他们有铁车。


士1:20
> As Moses had promised, Hebron was given to Caleb, who drove from it the three sons of Anak.
>
> 以色列人照摩西所说的，将希伯仑给了迦勒，迦勒就从那里赶出亚衲族的三个族长。


士1:21
> The Benjamites, however, failed to dislodge the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem; to this day the Jebusites live there with the Benjamites.
>
> 便雅悯人没有赶出住耶路撒冷的耶布斯人，耶布斯人仍在耶路撒冷与便雅悯人同住，直到今日。


士1:22
> Now the house of Joseph attacked Bethel, and the LORD was with them.
>
> 约瑟家也上去攻打伯特利，耶和华与他们同在。


士1:23
> When they sent men to spy out Bethel (formerly called Luz),
>
> 约瑟家打发人去窥探伯特利。那城起先名叫路斯。


士1:24
> the spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him, "Show us how to get into the city and we will see that you are treated well."
>
> 窥探的人看见一个人从城里出来，就对他说：“求你将进城的路指示我们，我们必恩待你。”


士1:25
> So he showed them, and they put the city to the sword but spared the man and his whole family.
>
> 那人将进城的路指示他们，他们就用刀击杀了城中的居民，但将那人和他全家放去。


士1:26
> He then went to the land of the Hittites, where he built a city and called it Luz, which is its name to this day.
>
> 那人往赫人之地去，筑了一座城，起名叫路斯。那城到如今还叫这名。


士1:27
> But Manasseh did not drive out the people of Beth Shan or Taanach or Dor or Ibleam or Megiddo and their surrounding settlements, for the Canaanites were determined to live in that land.
>
> 玛拿西没有赶出伯善和属伯善乡村的居民，他纳和属他纳乡村的居民，多珥和属多珥乡村的居民，以伯莲和属以伯莲乡村的居民，米吉多和属米吉多乡村的居民。迦南人却执意住在那些地方。


士1:28
> When Israel became strong, they pressed the Canaanites into forced labor but never drove them out completely.
>
> 及至以色列强盛了，就使迦南人做苦工，没有把他们全然赶出。


士1:29
> Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, but the Canaanites continued to live there among them.
>
> 以法莲没有赶出住基色的迦南人。于是，迦南人仍住在基色，在以法莲中间。


士1:30
> Neither did Zebulun drive out the Canaanites living in Kitron or Nahalol, who remained among them; but they did subject them to forced labor.
>
> 西布伦没有赶出基伦的居民和拿哈拉的居民。于是迦南人仍住在西布伦中间，成了服苦的人。


士1:31
> Nor did Asher drive out those living in Acco or Sidon or Ahlab or Aczib or Helbah or Aphek or Rehob,
>
> 亚设没有赶出亚柯和西顿的居民，亚黑拉和亚革悉的居民，黑巴、亚弗革与利合的居民。


士1:32
> and because of this the people of Asher lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land.
>
> 于是，亚设因为没有赶出那地的迦南人，就住在他们中间。


士1:33
> Neither did Naphtali drive out those living in Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath; but the Naphtalites too lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, and those living in Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath became forced laborers for them.
>
> 拿弗他利没有赶出伯示麦和伯亚纳的居民。于是，拿弗他利就住在那地的迦南人中间，然而伯示麦和伯亚纳的居民，成了服苦的人。


士1:34
> The Amorites confined the Danites to the hill country, not allowing them to come down into the plain.
>
> 亚摩利人强逼但人住在山地，不容他们下到平原。


士1:35
> And the Amorites were determined also to hold out in Mount Heres, Aijalon and Shaalbim, but when the power of the house of Joseph increased, they too were pressed into forced labor.
>
> 亚摩利人却执意住在希烈山和亚雅伦并沙宾。然而约瑟家胜了他们，使他们成了服苦的人。


士1:36
> The boundary of the Amorites was from Scorpion Pass to Sela and beyond.
>
> 亚摩利人的境界，是从亚克拉滨坡，从西拉而上。


## 士师记第2章
士2:1
> The angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said, "I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land that I swore to give to your forefathers. I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you,
>
> 耶和华的使者从吉甲上到波金，对以色列人说：“我使你们从埃及上来，领你们到我向你们列祖起誓应许之地。我又说：‘我永不废弃与你们所立的约。


士2:2
> and you shall not make a covenant with the people of this land, but you shall break down their altars.' Yet you have disobeyed me. Why have you done this?
>
> 你们也不可与这地的居民立约，要拆毁他们的祭坛。’你们竟没有听从我的话！为何这样行呢？


士2:3
> Now therefore I tell you that I will not drive them out before you; they will be thorns in your sides and their gods will be a snare to you."
>
> 因此我又说：‘我必不将他们从你们面前赶出。他们必作你们肋下的荆棘，他们的　神必作你们的网罗。’”


士2:4
> When the angel of the LORD had spoken these things to all the Israelites, the people wept aloud,
>
> 耶和华的使者向以色列众人说这话的时候，百姓就放声而哭。


士2:5
> and they called that place Bokim. There they offered sacrifices to the LORD.
>
> 于是给那地方起名叫波金（就是“哭”的意思），众人在那里向耶和华献祭。


士2:6
> After Joshua had dismissed the Israelites, they went to take possession of the land, each to his own inheritance.
>
> 从前约书亚打发以色列百姓去的时候，他们各归自己的地业，占据地土。


士2:7
> The people served the LORD throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had seen all the great things the LORD had done for Israel.
>
> 约书亚在世和约书亚死后，那些见耶和华为以色列人所行大事的长老还在的时候，百姓都事奉耶和华。


士2:8
> Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of a hundred and ten.
>
> 耶和华的仆人，嫩的儿子约书亚，正一百一十岁就死了。


士2:9
> And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Heres in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
>
> 以色列人将他葬在他地业的境内，就是在以法莲山地的亭拿希烈，在迦实山的北边。


士2:10
> After that whole generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation grew up, who knew neither the LORD nor what he had done for Israel.
>
> 那世代的人也都归了自己的列祖。后来有别的世代兴起，不知道耶和华，也不知道耶和华为以色列人所行的事。


士2:11
> Then the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD and served the Baals.
>
> 以色列人行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，去事奉诸巴力，


士2:12
> They forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of Egypt. They followed and worshiped various gods of the peoples around them. They provoked the LORD to anger
>
> 离弃了领他们出埃及地的耶和华、他们列祖的　神，去叩拜别　神，就是四围列国的神，惹耶和华发怒。


士2:13
> because they forsook him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.
>
> 并离弃耶和华，去事奉巴力和亚斯她录。


士2:14
> In his anger against Israel the LORD handed them over to raiders who plundered them. He sold them to their enemies all around, whom they were no longer able to resist.
>
> 耶和华的怒气向以色列人发作，就把他们交在抢夺他们的人手中。又将他们付与四围仇敌的手中，甚至他们在仇敌面前再不能站立得住。


士2:15
> Whenever Israel went out to fight, the hand of the LORD was against them to defeat them, just as he had sworn to them. They were in great distress.
>
> 他们无论往何处去，耶和华都以灾祸攻击他们，正如耶和华所说的话，又如耶和华向他们所起的誓。他们便极其困苦。


士2:16
> Then the LORD raised up judges, who saved them out of the hands of these raiders.
>
> 耶和华兴起士师，士师就拯救他们脱离抢夺他们人的手。


士2:17
> Yet they would not listen to their judges but prostituted themselves to other gods and worshiped them. Unlike their fathers, they quickly turned from the way in which their fathers had walked, the way of obedience to the LORD'S commands.
>
> 他们却不听从士师，竟随从叩拜别　神，行了邪淫，速速地偏离他们列祖所行的道，不如他们列祖顺从耶和华的命令。


士2:18
> Whenever the LORD raised up a judge for them, he was with the judge and saved them out of the hands of their enemies as long as the judge lived; for the LORD had compassion on them as they groaned under those who oppressed and afflicted them.
>
> 耶和华为他们兴起士师，就与那士师同在。士师在世的一切日子，耶和华拯救他们脱离仇敌的手。他们因受欺压扰害，就哀声叹气，所以耶和华后悔了。


士2:19
> But when the judge died, the people returned to ways even more corrupt than those of their fathers, following other gods and serving and worshiping them. They refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways.
>
> 及至士师死后，他们就转去行恶，比他们列祖更甚，去事奉叩拜别　神，总不断绝顽梗的恶行。


士2:20
> Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel and said, "Because this nation has violated the covenant that I laid down for their forefathers and has not listened to me,
>
> 于是，耶和华的怒气向以色列人发作。他说：“因这民违背我吩咐他们列祖所守的约，不听从我的话，


士2:21
> I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left when he died.
>
> 所以约书亚死的时候所剩下的各族，我必不再从他们面前赶出。


士2:22
> I will use them to test Israel and see whether they will keep the way of the LORD and walk in it as their forefathers did."
>
> 为要借此试验以色列人，看他们肯照他们列祖谨守遵行我的道不肯。”


士2:23
> The LORD had allowed those nations to remain; he did not drive them out at once by giving them into the hands of Joshua.
>
> 这样，耶和华留下各族，不将他们速速赶出，也没有交付约书亚的手。


## 士师记第3章
士3:1
> These are the nations the LORD left to test all those Israelites who had not experienced any of the wars in Canaan
>
> 耶和华留下这几族，为要试验那不曾知道与迦南争战之事的以色列人，


士3:2
> (he did this only to teach warfare to the descendants of the Israelites who had not had previous battle experience):
>
> 好叫以色列的后代又知道又学习未曾晓得的战事。


士3:3
> the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living in the Lebanon mountains from Mount Baal Hermon to Lebo Hamath.
>
> 所留下的，就是非利士的五个首领和一切迦南人、西顿人，并住黎巴嫩山的希未人，从巴力黑们山直到哈马口。


士3:4
> They were left to test the Israelites to see whether they would obey the LORD'S commands, which he had given their forefathers through Moses.
>
> 留下这几族，为要试验以色列人，知道他们肯听从耶和华借摩西吩咐他们列祖的诫命不肯。


士3:5
> The Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
>
> 以色列人竟住在迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人中间，


士3:6
> They took their daughters in marriage and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
>
> 娶他们的女儿为妻，将自己的女儿嫁给他们的儿子，并事奉他们的　神。


士3:7
> The Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD; they forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the Asherahs.
>
> 以色列人行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，忘记耶和华他们的　神，去事奉诸巴力和亚舍拉。


士3:8
> The anger of the LORD burned against Israel so that he sold them into the hands of Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram Naharaim, to whom the Israelites were subject for eight years.
>
> 所以，耶和华的怒气向以色列人发作，就把他们交在米所波大米王古珊利萨田的手中。以色列人服事古珊利萨田八年。


士3:9
> But when they cried out to the LORD, he raised up for them a deliverer, Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, who saved them.
>
> 以色列人呼求耶和华的时候，耶和华就为他们兴起一位拯救者救他们，就是迦勒兄弟，基纳斯的儿子俄陀聂。


士3:10
> The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, so that he became Israel's judge and went to war. The LORD gave Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram into the hands of Othniel, who overpowered him.
>
> 耶和华的灵降在他身上，他就作了以色列的士师，出去争战。耶和华将米所波大米王古珊利萨田交在他手中，他便胜了古珊利萨田。


士3:11
> So the land had peace for forty years, until Othniel son of Kenaz died.
>
> 于是，国中太平四十年。基纳斯的儿子俄陀聂死了。


士3:12
> Once again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD, and because they did this evil the LORD gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel.
>
> 以色列人又行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，耶和华就使摩押王伊矶伦强盛，攻击以色列人。


士3:13
> Getting the Ammonites and Amalekites to join him, Eglon came and attacked Israel, and they took possession of the City of Palms.
>
> 伊矶伦招聚亚扪人和亚玛力人，去攻打以色列人，占据棕树城。


士3:14
> The Israelites were subject to Eglon king of Moab for eighteen years.
>
> 于是，以色列人服事摩押王伊矶伦十八年。


士3:15
> Again the Israelites cried out to the LORD, and he gave them a deliverer--Ehud, a left-handed man, the son of Gera the Benjamite. The Israelites sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab.
>
> 以色列人呼求耶和华的时候，耶和华就为他们兴起一位拯救者，就是便雅悯人基拉的儿子以笏，他是左手便利的。以色列人托他送礼物给摩押王伊矶伦。


士3:16
> Now Ehud had made a double-edged sword about a foot and a half long, which he strapped to his right thigh under his clothing.
>
> 以笏打了一把两刃的剑，长一肘，带在右腿上衣服里面。


士3:17
> He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab, who was a very fat man.
>
> 他将礼物献给摩押王伊矶伦，原来伊矶伦极其肥胖。


士3:18
> After Ehud had presented the tribute, he sent on their way the men who had carried it.
>
> 以笏献完礼物，便将抬礼物的人打发走了。


士3:19
> At the idols near Gilgal he himself turned back and said, "I have a secret message for you, O king." The king said, "Quiet!" And all his attendants left him.
>
> 自己却从靠近吉甲凿石之地回来说：“王啊，我有一件机密事奏告你。”王说：“回避吧！”于是左右侍立的人都退去了。


士3:20
> Ehud then approached him while he was sitting alone in the upper room of his summer palace and said, "I have a message from God for you." As the king rose from his seat,
>
> 以笏来到王面前，王独自一人坐在凉楼上。以笏说：“我奉　神的命报告你一件事。”王就从座位上站起来。


士3:21
> Ehud reached with his left hand, drew the sword from his right thigh and plunged it into the king's belly.
>
> 以笏便伸左手，从右腿上拔出剑来，刺入王的肚腹，


士3:22
> Even the handle sank in after the blade, which came out his back. Ehud did not pull the sword out, and the fat closed in over it.
>
> 连剑把都刺进去了。剑被肥肉夹住，他没有从王的肚腹拔出来，且穿通了后身。


士3:23
> Then Ehud went out to the porch; he shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them.
>
> 以笏就出到游廊，将楼门尽都关锁。


士3:24
> After he had gone, the servants came and found the doors of the upper room locked. They said, "He must be relieving himself in the inner room of the house."
>
> 以笏出来之后，王的仆人到了，看见楼门关锁，就说：“他必是在楼上大解。”


士3:25
> They waited to the point of embarrassment, but when he did not open the doors of the room, they took a key and unlocked them. There they saw their lord fallen to the floor, dead.
>
> 他们等烦了，见仍不开楼门，就拿钥匙开了。不料，他们的主人已死，倒在地上。


士3:26
> While they waited, Ehud got away. He passed by the idols and escaped to Seirah.
>
> 他们耽延的时候，以笏就逃跑了，经过凿石之地，逃到西伊拉。


士3:27
> When he arrived there, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went down with him from the hills, with him leading them.
>
> 到了，就在以法莲山地吹角。以色列人随着他下了山地，他在前头引路，


士3:28
> "Follow me," he ordered, "for the LORD has given Moab, your enemy, into your hands." So they followed him down and, taking possession of the fords of the Jordan that led to Moab, they allowed no one to cross over.
>
> 对他们说：“你们随我来，因为耶和华已经把你们的仇敌摩押人交在你们手中。”于是，他们跟着他下去，把守约旦河的渡口，不容摩押一人过去。


士3:29
> At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all vigorous and strong; not a man escaped.
>
> 那时，击杀了摩押人约有一万，都是强壮的勇士，没有一人逃脱。


士3:30
> That day Moab was made subject to Israel, and the land had peace for eighty years.
>
> 这样，摩押就被以色列人制伏了。国中太平八十年。


士3:31
> After Ehud came Shamgar son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad. He too saved Israel.
>
> 以笏之后，有亚拿的儿子珊迦，他用赶牛的棍子打死六百非利士人。他也救了以色列人。


## 士师记第4章
士4:1
> After Ehud died, the Israelites once again did evil in the eyes of the LORD.
>
> 以笏死后，以色列人又行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，


士4:2
> So the LORD sold them into the hands of Jabin, a king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth Haggoyim.
>
> 耶和华就把他们付与在夏琐作王的迦南王耶宾手中。他的将军是西西拉，住在外邦人的夏罗设。


士4:3
> Because he had nine hundred iron chariots and had cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years, they cried to the LORD for help.
>
> 耶宾王有铁车九百辆。他大大欺压以色列人二十年，以色列人就呼求耶和华。


士4:4
> Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was leading Israel at that time.
>
> 有一位女先知名叫底波拉，是拉比多的妻，当时作以色列的士师。


士4:5
> She held court under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites came to her to have their disputes decided.
>
> 她住在以法莲山地拉玛和伯特利中间，在底波拉的棕树下。以色列人都上她那里去听判断。


士4:6
> She sent for Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, "The LORD, the God of Israel, commands you: 'Go, take with you ten thousand men of Naphtali and Zebulun and lead the way to Mount Tabor.
>
> 她打发人从拿弗他利的基低斯，将亚比挪庵的儿子巴拉召了来，对他说：“耶和华以色列的　神吩咐你说：‘你率领一万拿弗他利和西布伦人上他泊山去。


士4:7
> I will lure Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his troops to the Kishon River and give him into your hands.'"
>
> 我必使耶宾的将军西西拉率领他的车辆和全军往基顺河，到你那里去，我必将他交在你手中。’”


士4:8
> Barak said to her, "If you go with me, I will go; but if you don't go with me, I won't go."
>
> 巴拉说：“你若同我去，我就去；你若不同我去，我就不去。”


士4:9
> "Very well," Deborah said, "I will go with you. But because of the way you are going about this, the honor will not be yours, for the LORD will hand Sisera over to a woman." So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh,
>
> 底波拉说：“我必与你同去，只是你在所行的路上得不着荣耀，因为耶和华要将西西拉交在一个妇人手里。”于是底波拉起来，与巴拉一同往基低斯去了。


士4:10
> where he summoned Zebulun and Naphtali. Ten thousand men followed him, and Deborah also went with him.
>
> 巴拉就招聚西布伦人和拿弗他利人到基低斯，跟他上去的有一万人。底波拉也同他上去。


士4:11
> Now Heber the Kenite had left the other Kenites, the descendants of Hobab, Moses' brother-in-law, and pitched his tent by the great tree in Zaanannim near Kedesh.
>
> 摩西岳父（或作“内兄”）何巴的后裔基尼人希百，曾离开基尼族，到靠近基低斯撒拿音的橡树旁支搭帐棚。


士4:12
> When they told Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,
>
> 有人告诉西西拉说：“亚比挪庵的儿子巴拉已经上他泊山了。”


士4:13
> Sisera gathered together his nine hundred iron chariots and all the men with him, from Harosheth Haggoyim to the Kishon River.
>
> 西西拉就聚集所有的铁车九百辆和跟随他的全军，从外邦人的夏罗设出来，到了基顺河。


士4:14
> Then Deborah said to Barak, "Go! This is the day the LORD has given Sisera into your hands. Has not the LORD gone ahead of you?" So Barak went down Mount Tabor, followed by ten thousand men.
>
> 底波拉对巴拉说：“你起来，今日就是耶和华将西西拉交在你手的日子。耶和华岂不在你前头行吗？”于是巴拉下了他泊山，跟随他有一万人。


士4:15
> At Barak's advance, the LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by the sword, and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot.
>

士7:8
> So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites to their tents but kept the three hundred, who took over the provisions and trumpets of the others. Now the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley.

士7:9
> During that night the LORD said to Gideon, "Get up, go down against the camp, because I am going to give it into your hands.

>
> 基甸到了，就听见一人将梦告诉同伴说：“我做了一梦，梦见一个大麦饼滚入米甸营中，到了帐幕，将帐幕撞倒，帐幕就翻转倾覆了。”


士7:14

> 基甸听见这梦和梦的讲解，就敬拜　神，回到以色列营中说：“起来吧！耶和华已将米甸的军队交在你们手中了。”


士7:16
> Dividing the three hundred men into three companies, he placed trumpets and empty jars in the hands of all of them, with torches inside.

## 士师记第8章
士8:1
> Now the Ephraimites asked Gideon, "Why have you treated us like this? Why didn't you call us when you went to fight Midian?" And they criticized him sharply.
>
> 以法莲人对基甸说：“你去与米甸人争战，没有招我们同去，为什么这样待我们呢？”他们就与基甸大大地争吵。


士8:2
> But he answered them, "What have I accomplished compared to you? Aren't the gleanings of Ephraim's grapes better than the full grape harvest of Abiezer?
>
> 基甸对他们说：“我所行的岂能比你们所行的呢？以法莲拾取剩下的葡萄，不强过亚比以谢所摘的葡萄吗？


士8:3
> God gave Oreb and Zeeb, the Midianite leaders, into your hands. What was I able to do compared to you?" At this, their resentment against him subsided.
>
> 神已将米甸人的两个首领俄立和西伊伯交在你们手中；我所行的岂能比你们所行的呢？”基甸说了这话，以法莲人的怒气就消了。


士8:4
> Gideon and his three hundred men, exhausted yet keeping up the pursuit, came to the Jordan and crossed it.

>
> 基甸说：“耶和华将西巴和撒慕拿交在我手之后，我就用野地的荆条和枳棘打伤你们。”


士8:8
> From there he went up to Peniel and made the same request of them, but they answered as the men of Succoth had.
>
> 基甸从那里上到毗努伊勒，对那里的人也是这样说；毗努伊勒人也与疏割人回答他的话一样。


士8:9
> So he said to the men of Peniel, "When I return in triumph, I will tear down this tower."
>
> 他向毗努伊勒人说：“我平平安安回来的时候，我必拆毁这楼。”

>
> 捉住疏割的一个少年人，问他：“疏割的首领长老是谁？”他就将首领长老七十七个人的名字写出来。


士8:15
> Then Gideon came and said to the men of Succoth, "Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me by saying, 'Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your exhausted men?'"
>
> 基甸到了疏割，对那里的人说：“你们从前讥诮我说：‘西巴和撒慕拿已经在你手里，你使我们将饼给跟随你的疲乏人吗？’现在西巴和撒慕拿在这里。”


士8:16

>
> 基甸问西巴和撒慕拿说：“你们在他泊山所杀的人是什么样式？”回答说：“他们好像你，各人都有王子的样式。”


士8:19

>
> 基甸说：“他们是我同母的弟兄。我指着永生的耶和华起誓，你们从前若存留他们的性命，我如今就不杀你们了。”


士8:20
> Turning to Jether, his oldest son, he said, "Kill them!" But Jether did not draw his sword, because he was only a boy and was afraid.
>
> 于是对他的长子益帖说：“你起来杀他们。”但益帖因为是童子，害怕不敢拔刀。


士8:21
> Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Come, do it yourself. 'As is the man, so is his strength.'" So Gideon stepped forward and killed them, and took the ornaments off their camels' necks.
>
> 西巴和撒慕拿说：“你自己起来杀我们吧！因为人如何，力量也是如何。”基甸就起来，杀了西巴和撒慕拿，夺获他们骆驼项上戴的月牙圈。

>
> 基甸又对他们说：“我有一件事求你们：请你们各人将所夺的耳环给我。”（原来仇敌是以实玛利人，都是戴金耳环的。）


士8:25

>
> 他们说：“我们情愿给你。”就铺开一件外衣，各人将所夺的耳环丢在其上。


士8:26
> The weight of the gold rings he asked for came to seventeen hundred shekels, not counting the ornaments, the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian or the chains that were on their camels' necks.
>
> 基甸所要出来的金耳环，重一千七百舍客勒金子。此外还有米甸王所戴的月环、耳坠和所穿的紫色衣服，并骆驼项上的金链子。


士8:27
> Gideon made the gold into an ephod, which he placed in Ophrah, his town. All Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family.
>
> 基甸以此制造了一个以弗得，设立在本城俄弗拉，后来以色列人拜那以弗得行了邪淫。这就作了基甸和他全家的网罗。


士8:28
> Thus Midian was subdued before the Israelites and did not raise its head again. During Gideon's lifetime, the land enjoyed peace forty years.

>
> 以别的儿子迦勒说：“亚比米勒是谁？示剑是谁？使我们服事他呢？他不是耶路巴力的儿子吗？他的帮手不是西布勒吗？你们可以服事示剑的父亲哈抹的后裔。我们为何服事亚比米勒呢？

> 参孙跟他父母下亭拿去。到了亭拿的葡萄园，见有一只少壮狮子向他吼叫。


士14:6
> The Spirit of the LORD came upon him in power so that he tore the lion apart with his bare hands as he might have torn a young goat. But he told neither his father nor his mother what he had done.
>
> 耶和华的灵大大感动参孙，他虽然手无器械，却将狮子撕裂，如同撕裂山羊羔一样。他行这事并没有告诉父母。


士14:7
> Then he went down and talked with the woman, and he liked her.
>
> 参孙下去与女子说话，就喜悦她。


士14:8
> Some time later, when he went back to marry her, he turned aside to look at the lion's carcass. In it was a swarm of bees and some honey,
>
> 过了些日子，再下去要娶那女子，转向道旁要看死狮，见有一群蜂子和蜜在死狮之内，


士14:9
> which he scooped out with his hands and ate as he went along. When he rejoined his parents, he gave them some, and they too ate it. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the lion's carcass.
>
> 就用手取蜜，且吃且走；到了父母那里，给他父母，他们也吃了，只是没有告诉这蜜是从死狮之内取来的。


士14:10
> Now his father went down to see the woman. And Samson made a feast there, as was customary for bridegrooms.
>
> 他父亲下去见女子。参孙在那里设摆筵宴，因为向来少年人都有这个规矩。


士14:11
> When he appeared, he was given thirty companions.
>
> 众人看见参孙，就请了三十个人陪伴他。


士14:12
> "Let me tell you a riddle," Samson said to them. "If you can give me the answer within the seven days of the feast, I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.
>
> 参孙对他们说：“我给你们出一个谜语，你们在七日筵宴之内，若能猜出意思告诉我，我就给你们三十件里衣，三十套衣裳；


士14:13
> If you can't tell me the answer, you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes." "Tell us your riddle," they said. "Let's hear it."
>
> 你们若不能猜出意思告诉我，你们就给我三十件里衣，三十套衣裳。”他们说：“请将谜语说给我们听。”


士14:14
> He replied, "Out of the eater, something to eat; out of the strong, something sweet." For three days they could not give the answer.
>
> 参孙对他们说：“吃的从吃者出来，甜的从强者出来。”他们三日不能猜出谜语的意思。


士14:15
> On the fourth day, they said to Samson's wife, "Coax your husband into explaining the riddle for us, or we will burn you and your father's household to death. Did you invite us here to rob us?"
>
> 到第七天，他们对参孙的妻说：“你诓哄你丈夫，探出谜语的意思告诉我们，免得我们用火烧你和你父家。你们请了我们来，是要夺我们所有的吗？”


士14:16
> Then Samson's wife threw herself on him, sobbing, "You hate me! You don't really love me. You've given my people a riddle, but you haven't told me the answer." "I haven't even explained it to my father or mother," he replied, "so why should I explain it to you?"
>
> 参孙的妻在丈夫面前啼哭说：“你是恨我，不是爱我，你给我本国的人出谜语，却没有将意思告诉我。”参孙回答说：“连我父母我都没有告诉，岂可告诉你呢？”


士14:17
> She cried the whole seven days of the feast. So on the seventh day he finally told her, because she continued to press him. She in turn explained the riddle to her people.
>
> 七日筵宴之内，她在丈夫面前啼哭，到第七天，逼着他，他才将谜语的意思告诉他妻，他妻就告诉本国的人。


士14:18
> Before sunset on the seventh day the men of the town said to him, "What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?" Samson said to them, "If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have solved my riddle."
>
> 到第七天，日头未落以前，那城里的人对参孙说：“有什么比蜜还甜呢？有什么比狮子还强呢？”参孙对他们说：“你们若非用我的母牛犊耕地，就猜不出我谜语的意思来。”


士14:19
> Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon him in power. He went down to Ashkelon, struck down thirty of their men, stripped them of their belongings and gave their clothes to those who had explained the riddle. Burning with anger, he went up to his father's house.
>
> 耶和华的灵大大感动参孙，他就下到亚实基伦击杀了三十个人，夺了他们的衣裳，将衣裳给了猜出谜语的人。参孙发怒，就上父家去了。


士14:20
> And Samson's wife was given to the friend who had attended him at his wedding.
>
> 参孙的妻便归了参孙的陪伴，就是作过他朋友的。


## 士师记第15章
士15:1
> Later on, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat and went to visit his wife. He said, "I'm going to my wife's room." But her father would not let him go in.
>
> 过了些日子，到割麦子的时候，参孙带着一只山羊羔去看他的妻说：“我要进内室见我的妻。”他岳父不容他进去，


士15:2
> "I was so sure you thoroughly hated her," he said, "that I gave her to your friend. Isn't her younger sister more attractive? Take her instead."
>
> 说：“我估定你是极其恨她，因此我将她给了你的陪伴。她的妹子不是比她还美丽吗？你可以娶来代替她吧！”


士15:3
> Samson said to them, "This time I have a right to get even with the Philistines; I will really harm them."
>
> 参孙说：“这回我加害于非利士人不算有罪。”


士15:4
> So he went out and caught three hundred foxes and tied them tail to tail in pairs. He then fastened a torch to every pair of tails,
>
> 于是，参孙去捉了三百只狐狸（或作“野狗”），将狐狸尾巴一对一对地捆上，将火把捆在两条尾巴中间。


士15:5
> lit the torches and let the foxes loose in the standing grain of the Philistines. He burned up the shocks and standing grain, together with the vineyards and olive groves.
>
> 点着火把，就放狐狸进入非利士人站着的禾稼，将堆集的禾捆和未割的禾稼，并橄榄园尽都烧了。


士15:6
> When the Philistines asked, "Who did this?" they were told, "Samson, the Timnite's son-in-law, because his wife was given to his friend." So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father to death.
>
> 非利士人说：“这事是谁做的呢？”有人说：“是亭拿人的女婿参孙，因为他岳父将他的妻给了他的陪伴。”于是，非利士人上去，用火烧了妇人和她的父亲。


士15:7
> Samson said to them, "Since you've acted like this, I won't stop until I get my revenge on you."
>
> 参孙对非利士人说：“你们既然这样行，我必向你们报仇才肯罢休。”


士15:8
> He attacked them viciously and slaughtered many of them. Then he went down and stayed in a cave in the rock of Etam.
>
> 参孙就大大击杀他们，连腿带腰都砍断了。他便下去，住在以坦磐的穴内。


士15:9
> The Philistines went up and camped in Judah, spreading out near Lehi.
>
> 非利士人上去安营在犹大，布散在利希。


士15:10
> The men of Judah asked, "Why have you come to fight us?" "We have come to take Samson prisoner," they answered, "to do to him as he did to us."
>
> 犹大人说：“你们为何上来攻击我们呢？”他们说：“我们上来是要捆绑参孙，他向我们怎样行，我们也要向他怎样行！”


士15:11
> Then three thousand men from Judah went down to the cave in the rock of Etam and said to Samson, "Don't you realize that the Philistines are rulers over us? What have you done to us?" He answered, "I merely did to them what they did to me."
>
> 于是，有三千犹大人下到以坦磐的穴内，对参孙说：“非利士人辖制我们，你不知道吗？你向我们行的是什么事呢？”他回答说：“他们向我怎样行，我也要向他们怎样行！”


士15:12
> They said to him, "We've come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines." Samson said, "Swear to me that you won't kill me yourselves."
>
> 犹大人对他说：“我们下来是要捆绑你，将你交在非利士人手中。”参孙说：“你们要向我起誓，应承你们自己不害死我。”


士15:13
> "Agreed," they answered. "We will only tie you up and hand you over to them. We will not kill you." So they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock.
>
> 他们说：“我们断不杀你，只要将你捆绑，交在非利士人手中。”于是用两条新绳捆绑参孙，将他从以坦磐带上去。


士15:14
> As he approached Lehi, the Philistines came toward him shouting. The Spirit of the LORD came upon him in power. The ropes on his arms became like charred flax, and the bindings dropped from his hands.
>
> 参孙到了利希，非利士人都迎着喧嚷。耶和华的灵大大感动参孙，他臂上的绳就像火烧的麻一样，他的绑绳都从他手上脱落下来。


士15:15
> Finding a fresh jawbone of a donkey, he grabbed it and struck down a thousand men.
>
> 他见一块未干的驴腮骨，就伸手拾起来，用以击杀一千人。


士15:16
> Then Samson said, "With a donkey's jawbone I have made donkeys of them. With a donkey's jawbone I have killed a thousand men."
>
> 参孙说：“我用驴腮骨杀人成堆，用驴腮骨杀了一千人。”


士15:17
> When he finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone; and the place was called Ramath Lehi.
>
> 说完这话，就把那腮骨从手里抛出去了。那地便叫拉末利希。


士15:18
> Because he was very thirsty, he cried out to the LORD, "You have given your servant this great victory. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?"
>
> 参孙甚觉口渴，就求告耶和华说：“你既借仆人的手施行这么大的拯救，岂可任我渴死，落在未受割礼的人手中呢？”


士15:19
> Then God opened up the hollow place in Lehi, and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his strength returned and he revived. So the spring was called En Hakkore, and it is still there in Lehi.
>
> 神就使利希的洼处裂开，有水从其中涌出来。参孙喝了，精　神复原，因此那泉名叫隐哈歌利，那泉直到今日还在利希。


士15:20
> Samson led Israel for twenty years in the days of the Philistines.
>
> 当非利士人辖制以色列人的时候，参孙作以色列的士师二十年。


## 士师记第16章
士16:1
> One day Samson went to Gaza, where he saw a prostitute. He went in to spend the night with her.
>
> 参孙到了迦萨，在那里看见一个妓女，就与她亲近。


士16:2
> The people of Gaza were told, "Samson is here!" So they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They made no move during the night, saying, "At dawn we'll kill him."
>
> 有人告诉迦萨人说：“参孙到这里来了！”他们就把他团团围住，终夜在城门悄悄埋伏说：“等到天亮我们便杀他。”


士16:3
> But Samson lay there only until the middle of the night. Then he got up and took hold of the doors of the city gate, together with the two posts, and tore them loose, bar and all. He lifted them to his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron.
>
> 参孙睡到半夜起来，将城门的门扇、门框、门闩一齐拆下来，扛在肩上，扛到希伯仑前的山顶上。


士16:4
> Some time later, he fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah.
>
> 后来，参孙在梭烈谷喜爱一个妇人，名叫大利拉。


士16:5
> The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, "See if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him up and subdue him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver."
>
> 非利士人的首领上去见那妇人，对她说：“求你诓哄参孙，探探他因何有这么大的力气，我们用何法能胜他，捆绑克制他，我们就每人给你一千一百舍客勒银子。”


士16:6
> So Delilah said to Samson, "Tell me the secret of your great strength and how you can be tied up and subdued."
>
> 大利拉对参孙说：“求你告诉我，你因何有这么大的力气，当用何法捆绑克制你？”


士16:7
> Samson answered her, "If anyone ties me with seven fresh thongs that have not been dried, I'll become as weak as any other man."
>
> 参孙回答说：“人若用七条未干的青绳子捆绑我，我就软弱像别人一样。”


士16:8
> Then the rulers of the Philistines brought her seven fresh thongs that had not been dried, and she tied him with them.
>
> 于是，非利士人的首领拿了七条未干的青绳子来交给妇人，她就用绳子捆绑参孙。


士16:9
> With men hidden in the room, she called to him, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" But he snapped the thongs as easily as a piece of string snaps when it comes close to a flame. So the secret of his strength was not discovered.
>
> 有人预先埋伏在妇人的内室里。妇人说：“参孙哪，非利士人拿你来了！”参孙就挣断绳子，如挣断经火的麻线一般。这样，他力气的根由人还是不知道。


士16:10
> Then Delilah said to Samson, "You have made a fool of me; you lied to me. Come now, tell me how you can be tied."
>
> 大利拉对参孙说：“你欺哄我，向我说谎言。现在求你告诉我当用何法捆绑你。”


士16:11
> He said, "If anyone ties me securely with new ropes that have never been used, I'll become as weak as any other man."
>
> 参孙回答说：“人若用没有使过的新绳捆绑我，我就软弱像别人一样。”


士16:12
> So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them. Then, with men hidden in the room, she called to him, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" But he snapped the ropes off his arms as if they were threads.
>
> 大利拉就用新绳捆绑他，对他说：“参孙哪，非利士人拿你来了！”有人预先埋伏在内室里。参孙将臂上的绳挣断了，如挣断一条线一样。


士16:13
> Delilah then said to Samson, "Until now, you have been making a fool of me and lying to me. Tell me how you can be tied." He replied, "If you weave the seven braids of my head into the fabric on the loom and tighten it with the pin, I'll become as weak as any other man." So while he was sleeping, Delilah took the seven braids of his head, wove them into the fabric
>
> 大利拉对参孙说：“你到如今还是欺哄我，向我说谎言。求你告诉我，当用何法捆绑你。”参孙回答说：“你若将我头上的七条发绺与纬线同织就可以了。”


士16:14
> and tightened it with the pin. Again she called to him, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" He awoke from his sleep and pulled up the pin and the loom, with the fabric.
>
> 于是，大利拉将他的发绺与纬线同织，用橛子钉住，对他说：“参孙哪，非利士人拿你来了！”参孙从睡中醒来，将机上的橛子和纬线，一齐都拔出来了。


士16:15
> Then she said to him, "How can you say, 'I love you,' when you won't confide in me? This is the third time you have made a fool of me and haven't told me the secret of your great strength."
>
> 大利拉对参孙说：“你既不与我同心，怎么说你爱我呢？你这三次欺哄我，没有告诉我，你因何有这么大的力气。”


士16:16
> With such nagging she prodded him day after day until he was tired to death.
>
> 大利拉天天用话催逼他，甚至他心里烦闷要死。


士16:17
> So he told her everything. "No razor has ever been used on my head," he said, "because I have been a Nazirite set apart to God since birth. If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me, and I would become as weak as any other man."
>
> 参孙就把心中所藏的都告诉了她，对她说：“向来人没有用剃头刀剃我的头，因为我自出母胎就归　神作拿细耳人；若剃了我的头发，我的力气就离开我，我便软弱像别人一样。”


士16:18
> When Delilah saw that he had told her everything, she sent word to the rulers of the Philistines, "Come back once more; he has told me everything." So the rulers of the Philistines returned with the silver in their hands.
>
> 大利拉见他把心中所藏的都告诉了她，就打发人到非利士人的首领那里，对他们说：“他已经把心中所藏的都告诉了我，请你们再上来一次。”于是，非利士人的首领手里拿着银子，上到妇人那里。


士16:19
> Having put him to sleep on her lap, she called a man to shave off the seven braids of his hair, and so began to subdue him. And his strength left him.
>
> 大利拉使参孙枕着她的膝睡觉，叫了一个人来剃除他头上的七条发绺。于是，大利拉克制他，他的力气就离开他了。


士16:20
> Then she called, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" He awoke from his sleep and thought, "I'll go out as before and shake myself free." But he did not know that the LORD had left him.
>
> 大利拉说：“参孙哪，非利士人拿你来了！”参孙从睡中醒来，心里说：‘我要像前几次出去活动身体。’他却不知道耶和华已经离开他了。


士16:21
> Then the Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes and took him down to Gaza. Binding him with bronze shackles, they set him to grinding in the prison.
>
> 非利士人将他拿住，剜了他的眼睛，带他下到迦萨，用铜链拘索他，他就在监里推磨。


士16:22
> But the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.
>
> 然而他的头发被剃之后，又渐渐长起来了。


士16:23
> Now the rulers of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, saying, "Our god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hands."
>
> 非利士人的首领聚集，要给他们的　神大衮献大祭，并且欢乐。因为他们说：“我们的　神将我们的仇敌参孙交在我们手中了。”


士16:24
> When the people saw him, they praised their god, saying, "Our god has delivered our enemy into our hands, the one who laid waste our land and multiplied our slain."
>
> 众人看见参孙，就赞美他们的　神说：“我们的　神将毁坏我们地、杀害我们许多人的仇敌，交在我们手中了。”


士16:25
> While they were in high spirits, they shouted, "Bring out Samson to entertain us." So they called Samson out of the prison, and he performed for them. When they stood him among the pillars,
>
> 他们正宴乐的时候，就说：“叫参孙来，在我们面前戏耍戏耍。”于是将参孙从监里提出来，他就在众人面前戏耍。他们使他站在两柱中间。


士16:26
> Samson said to the servant who held his hand, "Put me where I can feel the pillars that support the temple, so that I may lean against them."
>
> 参孙向拉他手的童子说：“求你让我摸着托房的柱子，我要靠一靠。”


士16:27
> Now the temple was crowded with men and women; all the rulers of the Philistines were there, and on the roof were about three thousand men and women watching Samson perform.
>
> 那时房内充满男女，非利士人的众首领也都在那里。房的平顶上约有三千男女，观看参孙戏耍。


士16:28
> Then Samson prayed to the LORD, "O Sovereign LORD, remember me. O God, please strengthen me just once more, and let me with one blow get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes."
>
> 参孙求告耶和华说：“主耶和华啊，求你眷念我。　神啊，求你赐我这一次的力量，使我在非利士人身上报那剜我双眼的仇。”


士16:29
> Then Samson reached toward the two central pillars on which the temple stood. Bracing himself against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other,
>
> 参孙就抱住托房的那两根柱子，左手抱一根，右手抱一根，


士16:30
> Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines!" Then he pushed with all his might, and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it. Thus he killed many more when he died than while he lived.
>
> 说：“我情愿与非利士人同死！”就尽力屈身，房子倒塌，压住首领和房内的众人。这样，参孙死时所杀的人，比活着所杀的还多。


士16:31
> Then his brothers and his father's whole family went down to get him. They brought him back and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had led Israel twenty years.
>
> 参孙的弟兄和他父的全家，都下去取他的尸首，抬上来葬在琐拉和以实陶中间，在他父玛挪亚的坟墓里。参孙作以色列的士师二十年。


## 士师记第17章
士17:1
> Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim
>
> 以法莲山地有一个人名叫米迦。


士17:2
> said to his mother, "The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard you utter a curse--I have that silver with me; I took it." Then his mother said, "The LORD bless you, my son!"
>
> 他对母亲说：“你那一千一百舍客勒银子被人拿去，你因此咒诅，并且告诉了我。看哪，这银子在我这里，是我拿去了。”他母亲说：“我儿啊，愿耶和华赐福与你！”


士17:3
> When he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said, "I solemnly consecrate my silver to the LORD for my son to make a carved image and a cast idol. I will give it back to you."
>
> 米迦就把这一千一百舍客勒银子还他母亲。他母亲说：“我分出这银子来为你献给耶和华，好雕刻一个像，铸成一个像。现在我还是交给你。”


士17:4
> So he returned the silver to his mother, and she took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who made them into the image and the idol. And they were put in Micah's house.
>
> 米迦将银子还他母亲，他母亲将二百舍客勒银子交给银匠，雕刻一个像，铸成一个像，安置在米迦的屋内。


士17:5
> Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some idols and installed one of his sons as his priest.

> 那时，以色列中没有王，各人任意而行。


士17:7
> A young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, who had been living within the clan of Judah,

> 犹大伯利恒有一个少年人，是犹大族的利未人，他在那里寄居。


士17:8
> left that town in search of some other place to stay. On his way he came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim.
>
> 这人离开犹大伯利恒城，要找一个可住的地方。行路的时候，到了以法莲山地，走到米迦的家。


士17:9
> Micah asked him, "Where are you from?" "I'm a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah," he said, "and I'm looking for a place to stay."
>
> 米迦问他说：“你从哪里来？”他回答说：“从犹大伯利恒来。我是利未人，要找一个可住的地方。”


士17:10
> Then Micah said to him, "Live with me and be my father and priest, and I'll give you ten shekels of silver a year, your clothes and your food."
>
> 米迦说：“你可以住在我这里，我以你为父为祭司。我每年给你十舍客勒银子，一套衣服和度日的食物。”利未人就进了他的家。


士17:11
> So the Levite agreed to live with him, and the young man was to him like one of his sons.
>
> 利未人情愿与那人同住，那人看这少年人如自己的儿子一样。


士17:12
> Then Micah installed the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in his house.

> 米迦分派这少年的利未人作祭司，他就住在米迦的家里。


士17:13
> And Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will be good to me, since this Levite has become my priest."
>
> 米迦说：“现在我知道耶和华必赐福与我，因我有一个利未人作祭司。”


## 士师记第18章
士18:1
> In those days Israel had no king. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking a place of their own where they might settle, because they had not yet come into an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
>
> 那时，以色列中没有王。但支派的人仍是寻地居住，因为到那日子，他们还没有在以色列支派中得地为业。


士18:2
> So the Danites sent five warriors from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land and explore it. These men represented all their clans. They told them, "Go, explore the land." The men entered the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah, where they spent the night.
>
> 但人从琐拉和以实陶打发本族中的五个勇士，去仔细窥探那地。吩咐他们说：“你们去窥探那地。”他们来到以法莲山地，进了米迦的住宅，就在那里住宿。


士18:3

>
> 他们临近米迦的住宅，听出那少年利未人的口音来，就进去问他说：“谁领你到这里来？你在这里做什么？你在这里得什么？”


士18:4
> He told them what Micah had done for him, and said, "He has hired me and I am his priest."

> 他回答说：“米迦待我如此如此，请我作祭司。”


士18:5
> Then they said to him, "Please inquire of God to learn whether our journey will be successful."
>
> 他们对他说：“请你求问　神，使我们知道所行的道路，通达不通达。”


士18:6
> The priest answered them, "Go in peace. Your journey has the LORD'S approval."
>
> 祭司对他们说：“你们可以平平安安地去，你们所行的道路是在耶和华面前的。”


士18:7
> So the five men left and came to Laish, where they saw that the people were living in safety, like the Sidonians, unsuspecting and secure. And since their land lacked nothing, they were prosperous. Also, they lived a long way from the Sidonians and had no relationship with anyone else.
>
> 五人就走了，来到拉亿，见那里的民安居无虑，如同西顿人安居一样。在那地没有人掌权扰乱他们，他们离西顿人也远，与别人没有来往。


士18:8
> When they returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers asked them, "How did you find things?"
>
> 五人回到琐拉和以实陶，见他们的弟兄。弟兄问他们说：“你们有什么话？”


士18:9
> They answered, "Come on, let's attack them! We have seen that the land is very good. Aren't you going to do something? Don't hesitate to go there and take it over.
>
> 他们回答说：“起来，我们上去攻击他们吧！我们已经窥探那地，见那地甚好。你们为何静坐不动呢？要急速前往得那地为业，不可迟延。


士18:10
> When you get there, you will find an unsuspecting people and a spacious land that God has put into your hands, a land that lacks nothing whatever."

> 上到犹大的基列耶琳，在基列耶琳后边安营。因此，那地方名叫玛哈尼但，直到今日。


士18:13
> From there they went on to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah's house.
>
> 他们从那里往以法莲山地去，来到米迦的住宅。


士18:14
> Then the five men who had spied out the land of Laish said to their brothers, "Do you know that one of these houses has an ephod, other household gods, a carved image and a cast idol? Now you know what to do."
>
> 从前窥探拉亿地的五个人对他们的弟兄说：“这宅子里有以弗得和家中的神像，并雕刻的像与铸成的像，你们知道吗？现在你们要想一想当怎样行。”


士18:15
> So they turned in there and went to the house of the young Levite at Micah's place and greeted him.
>
> 五人就进入米迦的住宅，到了那少年利未人的房内问他好。


士18:16
> The six hundred Danites, armed for battle, stood at the entrance to the gate.
>
> 那六百但人各带兵器，站在门口。


士18:17
> The five men who had spied out the land went inside and took the carved image, the ephod, the other household gods and the cast idol while the priest and the six hundred armed men stood at the entrance to the gate.
>
> 窥探地的五个人走进去，将雕刻的像、以弗得、家中的神像并铸成的像，都拿了去。祭司和带兵器的六百人，一同站在门口。


士18:18
> When these men went into Micah's house and took the carved image, the ephod, the other household gods and the cast idol, the priest said to them, "What are you doing?"
>
> 那五个人进入米迦的住宅，拿出雕刻的像、以弗得、家中的神像并铸成的像，祭司就问他们说：“你们做什么呢？”


士18:19
> They answered him, "Be quiet! Don't say a word. Come with us, and be our father and priest. Isn't it better that you serve a tribe and clan in Israel as priest rather than just one man's household?"
>
> 他们回答说：“不要作声，用手捂口，跟我们去吧！我们必以你为父为祭司。你作一家的祭司好呢？还是作以色列一族一支派的祭司好呢？”


士18:20
> Then the priest was glad. He took the ephod, the other household gods and the carved image and went along with the people.
>
> 祭司心里喜悦，便拿着以弗得和家中的神像并雕刻的像，进入他们中间。


士18:21
> Putting their little children, their livestock and their possessions in front of them, they turned away and left.
>
> 他们就转身离开那里，妻子、儿女、牲畜、财物，都在前头。


士18:22
> When they had gone some distance from Micah's house, the men who lived near Micah were called together and overtook the Danites.
>
> 离米迦的住宅已远，米迦的近邻都聚集来，追赶但人。


士18:23
> As they shouted after them, the Danites turned and said to Micah, "What's the matter with you that you called out your men to fight?"
>
> 呼叫但人。但人回头问米迦说：“你聚集这许多人来做什么呢？”


士18:24
> He replied, "You took the gods I made, and my priest, and went away. What else do I have? How can you ask, 'What's the matter with you?'"
>
> 米迦说：“你们将我所做的神像和祭司都带了去，我还有所剩的吗？怎么还问我说‘做什么’呢？”


士18:25
> The Danites answered, "Don't argue with us, or some hot-tempered men will attack you, and you and your family will lose your lives."
>
> 但人对米迦说：“你不要使我们听见你的声音，恐怕有性暴的人攻击你，以致你和你的全家尽都丧命。”


士18:26
> So the Danites went their way, and Micah, seeing that they were too strong for him, turned around and went back home.
>
> 但人还是走他们的路。米迦见他们的势力比自己强盛，就转身回家去了。


士18:27
> Then they took what Micah had made, and his priest, and went on to Laish, against a peaceful and unsuspecting people. They attacked them with the sword and burned down their city.
>
> 但人将米迦所做的神像和他的祭司都带到拉亿，见安居无虑的民，就用刀杀了那民，又放火烧了那城，


士18:28
> There was no one to rescue them because they lived a long way from Sidon and had no relationship with anyone else. The city was in a valley near Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt the city and settled there.
>
> 并无人搭救，因为离西顿远，他们又与别人没有来往。城在平原，那平原靠近伯利合。但人又在那里修城居住，


士18:29
> They named it Dan after their forefather Dan, who was born to Israel--though the city used to be called Laish.
>
> 照着他们始祖以色列之子但的名字，给那城起名叫但；原先那城名叫拉亿。


士18:30
> There the Danites set up for themselves the idols, and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the time of the captivity of the land.
>
> 但人就为自己设立那雕刻的像。摩西的孙子、革舜的儿子约拿单和他的子孙，作但支派的祭司，直到那地遭掳掠的日子。


士18:31
> They continued to use the idols Micah had made, all the time the house of God was in Shiloh.
>
> 神的殿在示罗多少日子，但人为自己设立米迦所雕刻的像，也在但多少日子。

> 当以色列中没有王的时候，有住以法莲山地那边的一个利未人，娶了一个犹大伯利恒的女子为妾。


士19:2

>
> 她丈夫起来，带着一个仆人、两匹驴去见她，用好话劝她回来。女子就引丈夫进入父家。她父见了那人，便欢欢喜喜地迎接。


士19:4
> His father-in-law, the girl's father, prevailed upon him to stay; so he remained with him three days, eating and drinking, and sleeping there.
>
> 那人的岳父，就是女子的父亲，将那人留下住了三天。于是二人一同吃喝住宿。


士19:5
> On the fourth day they got up early and he prepared to leave, but the girl's father said to his son-in-law, "Refresh yourself with something to eat; then you can go."
>
> 到第四天，利未人清早起来要走，女子的父亲对女婿说：“请你吃点饭，加添心力，然后可以行路。”


士19:6
> So the two of them sat down to eat and drink together. Afterward the girl's father said, "Please stay tonight and enjoy yourself."
>
> 于是二人坐下一同吃喝。女子的父亲对那人说：“请你再住一夜，畅快你的心。”


士19:7
> And when the man got up to go, his father-in-law persuaded him, so he stayed there that night.
>
> 那人起来要走，他岳父强留他，他又住了一宿。


士19:8
> On the morning of the fifth day, when he rose to go, the girl's father said, "Refresh yourself. Wait till afternoon!" So the two of them ate together.
>
> 到第五天，他清早起来要走。女子的父亲说：“请你吃点饭，加添心力，等到日头偏西再走。”于是二人一同吃饭。


士19:9
> Then when the man, with his concubine and his servant, got up to leave, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said, "Now look, it's almost evening. Spend the night here; the day is nearly over. Stay and enjoy yourself. Early tomorrow morning you can get up and be on your way home."
>
> 那人同他的妾和仆人起来要走，他岳父，就是女子的父亲，对他说：“看哪，日头偏西了，请你再住一夜，天快晚了，可以在这里住宿，畅快你的心。明天早早起行回家去。”


士19:10
> But, unwilling to stay another night, the man left and went toward Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine.
>
> 那人不愿再住一夜，就备上那两匹驴，带着妾起身走了，来到耶布斯的对面。耶布斯就是耶路撒冷。


士19:11
> When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant said to his master, "Come, let's stop at this city of the Jebusites and spend the night."
>
> 临近耶布斯的时候，日头快要落了。仆人对主人说：“我们不如进这耶布斯人的城里住宿。”


士19:12
> His master replied, "No. We won't go into an alien city, whose people are not Israelites. We will go on to Gibeah."
>
> 主人回答说：“我们不可进不是以色列人住的外邦城，不如过到基比亚去。”


士19:13
> He added, "Come, let's try to reach Gibeah or Ramah and spend the night in one of those places."
>
> 又对仆人说：“我们可以到一个地方，或住在基比亚，或住在拉玛。”


士19:14
> So they went on, and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin.
>
> 他们就往前走。将到便雅悯的基比亚，日头已经落了。


士19:15
> There they stopped to spend the night. They went and sat in the city square, but no one took them into his home for the night.

士19:18
> He answered, "We are on our way from Bethlehem in Judah to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim where I live. I have been to Bethlehem in Judah and now I am going to the house of the LORD. No one has taken me into his house.

> 于是领他们到家里，喂上驴，他们就洗脚吃喝。


士19:22
> While they were enjoying themselves, some of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they shouted to the old man who owned the house, "Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him."
>
> 他们心里正欢畅的时候，城中的匪徒围住房子，连连叩门，对房主老人说：“你把那进你家的人带出来，我们要与他交合。”


士19:23
> The owner of the house went outside and said to them, "No, my friends, don't be so vile. Since this man is my guest, don't do this disgraceful thing.

> 那房主出来对他们说：“弟兄们哪，不要这样作恶。这人既然进了我的家，你们就不要行这丑事。


士19:24
> Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But to this man, don't do such a disgraceful thing."

> 那些人却不听从他的话。那人就把他的妾拉出去交给他们，他们便与她交合，终夜凌辱她，直到天色快亮才放她去。


士19:26
> At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell down at the door and lay there until daylight.

士20:4
> So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, said, "I and my concubine came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night.
>
> 那利未人，就是被害之妇人的丈夫回答说：“我和我的妾到了便雅悯的基比亚住宿。

> 我们向基比亚人必这样行，照所掣的签去攻击他们。


士20:10
> We'll take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred from a thousand, and a thousand from ten thousand, to get provisions for the army. Then, when the army arrives at Gibeah in Benjamin, it can give them what they deserve for all this vileness done in Israel."

> 以色列人问耶和华说，我们当再出去与我们弟兄便雅悯人打仗呢。还是吧兵呢。耶和华说，你们当上去，因为明日我必将他们交在你们手中。


士20:29
> Then Israel set an ambush around Gibeah.

> 以色列人在基比亚的四围设下伏兵。


士20:30
> They went up against the Benjamites on the third day and took up positions against Gibeah as they had done before.

士20:31
> The Benjamites came out to meet them and were drawn away from the city. They began to inflict casualties on the Israelites as before, so that about thirty men fell in the open field and on the roads--the one leading to Bethel and the other to Gibeah.

> 以色列众人都起来，在巴力他玛摆阵，以色列的伏兵从马利迦巴埋伏的地方冲上前去。


士20:34
> Then ten thousand of Israel's finest men made a frontal attack on Gibeah. The fighting was so heavy that the Benjamites did not realize how near disaster was.

> 有以色列人中的一万精兵，来到基比亚前接战，势派甚是凶猛，便雅悯人却不知道灾祸临近了。


士20:35
> The LORD defeated Benjamin before Israel, and on that day the Israelites struck down 25,100 Benjamites, all armed with swords.
>
> 耶和华使以色列人杀败便雅悯人。那日，以色列人杀死便雅悯人二万五千一百，都是拿刀的。


士20:36
> Then the Benjamites saw that they were beaten. Now the men of Israel had given way before Benjamin, because they relied on the ambush they had set near Gibeah.
>
> 于是便雅悯人知道自己败了。先是以色列人，因为靠着在基比亚前所设的伏兵，就在便雅悯人面前诈败。


士20:37
> The men who had been in ambush made a sudden dash into Gibeah, spread out and put the whole city to the sword.

> 伏兵急忙闯进基比亚，用刀杀死全城的人。


士20:38
> The men of Israel had arranged with the ambush that they should send up a great cloud of smoke from the city,

> 以色列人预先同伏兵约定在城内放火，以烟气上腾为号。


士20:39

>
> 以色列人临退阵的时候，便雅悯人动手杀死以色列人，约有三十个，就说：“他们仍像前次被我们杀败了。”


士20:40
> But when the column of smoke began to rise from the city, the Benjamites turned and saw the smoke of the whole city going up into the sky.
>
> 当烟气如柱从城中上腾的时候，便雅悯人回头观看，见全城的烟气冲天。


士20:41
> Then the men of Israel turned on them, and the men of Benjamin were terrified, because they realized that disaster had come upon them.
>
> 以色列人又转身回来，便雅悯人就甚惊惶，因为看见灾祸临到自己了。


士20:42
> So they fled before the Israelites in the direction of the desert, but they could not escape the battle. And the men of Israel who came out of the towns cut them down there.
>
> 他们在以色列人面前转身往旷野逃跑，以色列人在后面追杀。那从各城里出来的，也都夹攻杀灭他们。


士20:43
> They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them and easily overran them in the vicinity of Gibeah on the east.

士20:48
> The men of Israel went back to Benjamin and put all the towns to the sword, including the animals and everything else they found. All the towns they came across they set on fire.
>
> 以色列人又转到便雅悯地，将各城的人和牲畜，并一切所遇见的，都用刀杀尽，又放火烧了一切城邑。

士21:1
> The men of Israel had taken an oath at Mizpah: "Not one of us will give his daughter in marriage to a Benjamite."

> 以色列人彼此问说：“以色列各支派中，谁没有同会众上到耶和华面前来呢？”先是以色列人起过大誓说，凡不上米斯巴到耶和华面前来的，必将他治死。


士21:6
> Now the Israelites grieved for their brothers, the Benjamites. "Today one tribe is cut off from Israel," they said.
>
> 以色列人为他们的弟兄便雅悯后悔说：“如今以色列中绝了一个支派了。


士21:7
> "How can we provide wives for those who are left, since we have taken an oath by the LORD not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?"
>
> 我们既在耶和华面前起誓说：必不将我们的女儿给便雅悯人为妻，现在我们当怎样办理，使他们剩下的人有妻呢？”


士21:8
> Then they asked, "Which one of the tribes of Israel failed to assemble before the LORD at Mizpah?" They discovered that no one from Jabesh Gilead had come to the camp for the assembly.
>
> 又彼此问说：“以色列支派中谁没有上米斯巴到耶和华面前来呢？”他们就查出基列雅比没有一人进营到会众那里，


士21:9
> For when they counted the people, they found that none of the people of Jabesh Gilead were there.
>
> 因为百姓被数的时候，没有一个基列雅比人在那里。


士21:10
> So the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to go to Jabesh Gilead and put to the sword those living there, including the women and children.
>
> 会众就打发一万二千大勇士，吩咐他们说：“你们去用刀将基列雅比人连妇女带孩子都击杀了。


士21:11
> "This is what you are to do," they said. "Kill every male and every woman who is not a virgin."
>
> 所当行的就是这样：要将一切男子和已嫁的女子尽行杀戮。”


士21:12
> They found among the people living in Jabesh Gilead four hundred young women who had never slept with a man, and they took them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan.
>
> 他们在基列雅比人中，遇见了四百个未嫁的处女，就带到迦南地的示罗营里。


士21:13
> Then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon.
>
> 全会众打发人到临门磐的便雅悯人那里，向他们说和睦的话。


士21:14
> So the Benjamites returned at that time and were given the women of Jabesh Gilead who had been spared. But there were not enough for all of them.
>
> 当时，便雅悯人回来了，以色列人就把所存活基列雅比的女子给他们为妻，还是不够。


士21:15
> The people grieved for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a gap in the tribes of Israel.
>
> 百姓为便雅悯人后悔，因为耶和华使以色列人缺了一个支派（原文作“使以色列中有了破口”）。


士21:16
> And the elders of the assembly said, "With the women of Benjamin destroyed, how shall we provide wives for the men who are left?
>
> 会中的长老说：“便雅悯中的女子既然除灭了，我们当怎样办理，使那余剩的人有妻呢？”


士21:17
> The Benjamite survivors must have heirs," they said, "so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out.
>
> 又说：“便雅悯逃脱的人当有地业，免得以色列中涂抹了一个支派。


士21:18
> We can't give them our daughters as wives, since we Israelites have taken this oath: 'Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.'
>
> 只是我们不能将自己的女儿给他们为妻，因为以色列人曾起誓说：‘有将女儿给便雅悯人为妻的，必受咒诅。’”


士21:19
> But look, there is the annual festival of the LORD in Shiloh, to the north of Bethel, and east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem, and to the south of Lebonah."
>
> 他们又说：“在利波拿以南，伯特利以北，在示剑大路以东的示罗，年年有耶和华的节期。”


士21:20
> So they instructed the Benjamites, saying, "Go and hide in the vineyards
>
> 就吩咐便雅悯人说：“你们去，在葡萄园中埋伏。


士21:21
> and watch. When the girls of Shiloh come out to join in the dancing, then rush from the vineyards and each of you seize a wife from the girls of Shiloh and go to the land of Benjamin.
>
> 若看见示罗的女子出来跳舞，就从葡萄园出来，在示罗的女子中各抢一个为妻，回便雅悯地去。


士21:22
> When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we will say to them, 'Do us a kindness by helping them, because we did not get wives for them during the war, and you are innocent, since you did not give your daughters to them.'"
>
> 他们的父亲或是弟兄若来与我们争竞，我们就说：‘求你们看我们的情面，施恩给这些人，因我们在争战的时候没有给他们留下女子为妻。这也不是你们将女子给他们的，若是你们给的，就算有罪。’”


士21:23
> So that is what the Benjamites did. While the girls were dancing, each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife. Then they returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in them.
>
> 于是，便雅悯人照样而行，按着他们的数目从跳舞的女子中抢去为妻，就回自己的地业去，又重修城邑居住。


士21:24
> At that time the Israelites left that place and went home to their tribes and clans, each to his own inheritance.
>
> 当时以色列人离开那里，各归本支派、本宗族、本地业去了。


士21:25
> In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as he saw fit.
>
> 那时以色列中没有王，各人任意而行。
