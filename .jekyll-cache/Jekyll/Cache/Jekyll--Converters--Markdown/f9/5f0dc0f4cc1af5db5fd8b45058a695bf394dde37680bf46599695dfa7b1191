I"à<p>After finishing the main menu last week, I decided to take a look at implementing compatibility with 
joysticks for our game. It was something I figured was best to be tackled early on, I also felt it 
was something essential for a platforming game.</p>

<h1 id="setting-the-inputs">Setting the Inputs</h1>

<p>My first task was to edit the built-in inputs found in Unity‚Äôs Input settings. A very useful feature,
it allowed me to designate the inputs of the game as I saw fit, I could name them what I wished, add
as many as I liked, etc. I took the opportunity to decide on all of the game‚Äôs controls then and there.
Below is the list of all of the game‚Äôs inputs so far.</p>

The entire list of the game‚Äôs inputs.</p>

<p>You‚Äôll notice that there are two of each input in the image above. The reason for this is that, for
each button, there is an input for keyboards and an input for joysticks. Both inputs are named the
same so that, when coding, if I specify ‚ÄúBtnA‚Äù, the name will apply to both inputs. This means that
the input will be read regardless of whether the player is using a keyboard or joystick. Below is a
closer look at the two inputs for one button.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="/assets/img/post_images/jack_images/week-6-keyboard-vs-joystick.png" alt="All inputs" class="lead" />
The vertical directional button‚Äôs inputs, the above for keyboard, the bottom for joystick. Note the differences highlighted in orange.</p>

<p>As can be seen above, the most notable differences are seen in the ‚ÄúGravity‚Äù, ‚ÄúDead‚Äù and ‚ÄúSensitivity‚Äù
fields. It took some research to find out which values for these fields suited a joystick and which 
values suited a keyboard. For instance, the Gravity and Sensitivity are set very high for the keyboard buttons
since we want them to become inactive as soon as the player lets go of them, whereas the joystick‚Äôs axis detects
input over a continuous range of values.</p>

<p>For a clearer picture of how I‚Äôve set out the game‚Äôs controls, below here‚Äôs the layout of our controls mapped
onto the Xbox 360 controller, a joystick most commonly used with PCs.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="/assets/img/post_images/jack_images/week-6-gamepad-layout.png" alt="360 Controller Layout" class="lead" />
Our controls at this point in time.</p>

<p>As seen above, directional movement of our character is manipulated with the axes on the bottom left of the 
controller. Players often prefer to use the analog stick above this directional pad, so in future I will likely
duplicate the directional pad‚Äôs functionality and apply it to the left analog stick, giving the player the choice 
of using whichever axis they prefer for movement.</p>

<h1 id="the-problem-i-encountered">The Problem I Encountered</h1>

<p>When first setting up movement with the axis, I used my main menu as the area for testing input. Right away I noticed
a major issue: pressing down once on the joystick‚Äôs D-Pad would move my highlighter all the way to the bottom menu option.
After some research I realised that, since the D-Pad was an axis and not a button (with continuous input detection instead
of discrete), the game was detecting my input multiple times per frame and hence making menu navigation next to 
impossible.</p>

<p>After a lot of research as well as trial and error, I finally derived two methods that solved the problem for me.
The methods make use of a bool called ‚ÄúaxisInUse‚Äù. When the player presses on the axis, the input will only be read if
the aforementioned bool is false.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="/assets/img/post_images/jack_images/week-6-axis-as-button-method.png" alt="Checking Axis Input as a Button Press" class="lead" />
The first method reads the input and sets the bool to true, helping the input to be read as if it was a button press.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="/assets/img/post_images/jack_images/week-6-check-axis-use-method.png" alt="Checking Axis Input" class="lead" />
The second method is constantly checking if the axes are still in use, if they are not in use, the bool is reset, allowing for further input from the player.</p>

<p>Overall, I‚Äôm happy with how the inputs for the game have been set so far. I think it‚Äôll stand to us in future for when we‚Äôre implementing
the gameplay mechanics our inputs will manipulate. Of course, it‚Äôs also good to remain vigilant for any further input issues that could arise.</p>

<p>As for next week, I‚Äôd like to start working on some content for the level, first though, I want to tackle a bug I‚Äôve spotted in my main menu.</p>

<p>‚ÄòTil next time!</p>
