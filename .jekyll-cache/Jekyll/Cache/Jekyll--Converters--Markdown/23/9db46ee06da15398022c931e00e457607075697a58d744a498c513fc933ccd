I"Y<p>This week was mostly research and set-up for the new movement system I wanted to implement for the game. My
attention was brought to a site named <a href="https://sonicretro.org/">Sonic Retro</a>, a fansite for the Sonic the Hedgehog
franchise. On this site in particular was a <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Physics_Guide">physics guide</a> with information as 
to how physics are calculated in the classic Sonic games. I decided to read up on this guide as it may provide assistance in 
implementing the movement system for our game, since it is inspired by the early Sonic games.</p>
