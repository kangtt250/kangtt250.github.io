>
> 就如　神从创立世界以前，在基督里拣选了我们，使我们在他面前成为圣洁，无有瑕疵；


弗1:5

> 要照所安排的，在日期满足的时候，使天上地上一切所有的，都在基督里面同归于一。


弗1:11
> In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will,

弗2:1
> As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins,
>
> 你们死在过犯罪恶之中，他叫你们活过来。


弗2:2
> in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient.
>
> 那时，你们在其中行事为人，随从今世的风俗，顺服空中掌权者的首领，就是现今在悖逆之子心中运行的邪灵。


弗2:3
> All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath.
>
> 我们从前也都在他们中间，放纵肉体的私欲，随着肉体和心中所喜好的去行，本为可怒之子，和别人一样。

弗2:8
> For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God--

弗2:10
> For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.
>
> 我们原是他的工作，在基督耶稣里造成的，为要叫我们行善，就是　神所预备叫我们行的。


弗2:11
> Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called "uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "the circumcision" (that done in the body by the hands of men)--
>
> 所以你们应当记念，你们从前按肉体是外邦人，是称为没受割礼的，这名原是那些凭人手在肉身上称为受割礼之人所起的。


弗2:12
> remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world.
>
> 那时，你们与基督无关，在以色列国民以外，在所应许的诸约上是局外人，并且活在世上没有指望，没有　神。

>
> 因他使我们和睦（原文作“因他是我们的和睦”），将两下合而为一，拆毁了中间隔断的墙，

> by abolishing in his flesh the law with its commandments and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace,
>
> 而且以自己的身体废掉冤仇，就是那记在律法上的规条，为要将两下藉着自己造成一个新人，如此便成就了和睦。

> and in this one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility.
>
> 既在十字架上灭了冤仇，便藉这十字架使两下归为一体，与　神和好了，


弗2:17
> He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.
>
> 并且来传和平的福音给你们远处的人，也给那近处的人。


弗2:18
> For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.
>
> 因为我们两下藉着他被一个圣灵所感，得以进到父面前。


弗2:19
> Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God's people and members of God's household,
>
> 这样，你们不再作外人和客旅，是与圣徒同国，是　神家里的人了。

>
> 你们念了，就能晓得我深知基督的奥秘，


弗3:5
> which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets.
>
> 这奥秘在以前的世代没有叫人知道，像如今藉着圣灵启示他的圣使徒和先知一样。


弗3:6
> This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.
>
> 这奥秘就是外邦人在基督耶稣里，藉着福音，得以同为后嗣，同为一体，同蒙应许。


弗3:7
> I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of his power.
>
> 我作了这福音的执事，是照　神的恩赐，这恩赐是照他运行的大能赐给我的。


弗3:8
> Although I am less than the least of all God's people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,
>
> 我本来比众圣徒中最小的还小，然而他还赐我这恩典，叫我把基督那测不透的丰富传给外邦人。


弗3:9
> and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.
>
> 又使众人都明白，这历代以来隐藏在创造万物之神里的奥秘，是如何安排的，


弗3:10
> His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,

弗4:7
> But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it.

> 我们各人蒙恩，都是照基督所量给各人的恩赐。


弗4:8
> This is why it says: "When he ascended on high, he led captives in his train and gave gifts to men."
>
> 所以经上说：“他升上高天的时候，掳掠了仇敌，将各样的恩赐赏给人。”


弗4:9
> (What does "he ascended" mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions?
>
> （既说升上，岂不是先降在地下吗？


弗4:10
> He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.)

>
> 使我们不再作小孩子，中了人的诡计和欺骗的法术，被一切异教之风摇动，飘来飘去，就随从各样的异端。


弗4:15
> Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ.
>
> 惟用爱心说诚实话，凡事长进，连于元首基督。


弗4:16
> From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.

弗4:17
> So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.
>

> They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.

> Surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.
>
> 如果你们听过他的道，领了他的教，学了他的真理，


弗4:22
> You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;
>
> 就要脱去你们从前行为上的旧人，这旧人是因私欲的迷惑渐渐变坏的。


弗4:23
> to be made new in the attitude of your minds;
>
> 又要将你们的心志改换一新，


弗4:24
> and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.
>
> 并且穿上新人，这新人是照着　神的形像造的，有真理的仁义和圣洁。


弗4:25
> Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all members of one body.
>
> 所以你们要弃绝谎言，各人与邻舍说实话，因为我们是互相为肢体。


弗4:26

弗4:28
> He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with his own hands, that he may have something to share with those in need.
>
> 从前偷窃的，不要再偷；总要劳力，亲手做正经事，就可有余，分给那缺少的人。


弗4:29
> Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.
>
> 污秽的言语，一句不可出口，只要随事说造就人的好话，叫听见的人得益处。


弗4:30
> And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
>
> 不要叫　神的圣灵担忧；你们原是受了他的印记，等候得赎的日子来到。


弗4:31
> Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.
>
> 一切苦毒、恼恨、忿怒、嚷闹、毁谤，并一切的恶毒（或作“阴毒”），都当从你们中间除掉。


弗4:32
> Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.
>
> 并要以恩慈相待，存怜悯的心，彼此饶恕，正如　神在基督里饶恕了你们一样。


## 以弗所书第5章
弗5:1
> Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children
>
> 所以你们该效法　神，好像蒙慈爱的儿女一样。


弗5:2
> and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
>
> 也要凭爱心行事，正如基督爱我们，为我们舍了自己，当作馨香的供物和祭物献与　神。


弗5:3
> But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy people.
>
> 至于淫乱并一切污秽，或是贪婪，在你们中间连提都不可，方合圣徒的体统。


弗5:4
> Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.
>
> 淫词、妄语和戏笑的话都不相宜，总要说感谢的话。


弗5:5
> For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person--such a man is an idolater--has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
>
> 因为你们确实地知道，无论是淫乱的，是污秽的，是有贪心的，在基督和　神的国里都是无分的。有贪心的，就与拜偶像的一样。


弗5:6
> Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient.
>
> 不要被人虚浮的话欺哄，因这些事，　神的忿怒必临到那悖逆之子。


弗5:7
> Therefore do not be partners with them.
>
> 所以你们不要与他们同夥。


弗5:8
> For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light
>

>
> 光明所结的果子就是一切良善、公义、诚实。


弗5:10
> and find out what pleases the Lord.
>
> 总要察验何为主所喜悦的事。


弗5:11
> Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.
>
> 那暗昧无益的事，不要与人同行，倒要责备行这事的人。


弗5:12
> For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.
>
> 因为他们暗中所行的，就是提起来也是可耻的。


弗5:13
> But everything exposed by the light becomes visible,
>
> 凡事受了责备，就被光显明出来，因为一切能显明的就是光。


弗5:14
> for it is light that makes everything visible. This is why it is said: "Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."
>
> 所以主说：“你这睡着的人当醒过来，从死里复活，基督就要光照你了。”


弗5:15
> Be very careful, then, how you live--not as unwise but as wise,
>
> 你们要谨慎行事，不要像愚昧人，当像智慧人。


弗5:16

>
> 又当存敬畏基督的心，彼此顺服。


弗5:22
> Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.
>
> 你们作妻子的，当顺服自己的丈夫，如同顺服主。


弗5:23
> For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.
>
> 因为丈夫是妻子的头，如同基督是教会的头，他又是教会全体的救主。


弗5:24
> Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
>
> 教会怎样顺服基督，妻子也要怎样凡事顺服丈夫。


弗5:25
> Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her
>

弗5:28
> In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.
>
> 丈夫也当照样爱妻子，如同爱自己的身子，爱妻子便是爱自己了。


弗5:29
> After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church--
>
> 从来没有人恨恶自己的身子，总是保养顾惜，正像基督待教会一样，


弗5:30
> for we are members of his body.
>
> 因我们是他身上的肢体（有古卷在此有“就是他的骨、他的肉”）。


弗5:31
> "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."
>
> 为这个缘故，人要离开父母，与妻子连合，二人成为一体。


弗5:32
> This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church.
>
