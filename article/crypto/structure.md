🧵 Why most crypto trading strategies *don’t fail at alpha*, but die at structure?

Let’s talk about the invisible layer between a strategy and real capital.

This thread is for:
- Traders with alpha but no investors
- PMs struggling to scale
- LPs frustrated with crypto funds


1/ In TradFi, a strategy becomes a product because it fits into a **known structure**:
- SMA
- LP fund
- SPV
- Managed account
The structure communicates *access, rights, risks*.

In Crypto, most strategies = performance with no structure.

2/ What is “structure”?

It’s how you:
- custody the assets  
- prove performance  
- define profit-sharing  
- control risk  
- ensure legal/operational clarity  
It’s the infrastructure that turns *alpha into capital*.

3/ Common structural dead-ends:

- CEX's sub-account → not LP-friendly  
- Telegram OTC deal → no legal wrap  
- DAO asset management → regulatory black hole  
- High-return backtests → no KYC access

Your alpha is real, but your **structure is undefined**.

4/ LPs don’t fund alpha. They fund *structured access* to alpha.

- Risk-adjusted  
- Legally wrapped  
- Operationally sound  
- Exit-defined  

That’s why most “10% per month” strategies get $0 invested.

5/ The new winners in Crypto aren’t just traders.

They are **strategy architects** — people who:
- know what LPs want  
- can wrap a strategy into fund/token/SMA  
- understand custody, audits, payouts, fees

Smart money now needs *Structured Alpha*.

6/ Structura exists to map this blind spot.

We study how:
- Strategies become products  
- Products become regulated funds  
- Funds get LP-ready

Alpha ≠ outcome.  
**Structure = outcome.**
