伯1:1
> In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil.
>
> 乌斯地有一个人，名叫约伯。那人完全正直，敬畏　神，远离恶事。


伯1:2
> He had seven sons and three daughters,
>
> 他生了七个儿子，三个女儿。


伯1:3
> and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.
>
> 他的家产有七千羊，三千骆驼，五百对牛，五百母驴，并有许多仆婢。这人在东方人中就为至大。


伯1:4
> His sons used to take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
>
> 他的儿子按着日子，各在自己家里设摆筵宴，就打发人去请了他们的三个姐妹来，与他们一同吃喝。


伯1:5
> When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would send and have them purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular custom.
>
> 筵宴的日子过了，约伯打发人去叫他们自洁。他清早起来，按着他们众人的数目献燔祭；因为他说：“恐怕我儿子犯了罪，心中弃掉　神。”约伯常常这样行。


伯1:6
> One day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them.
>
> 有一天，　神的众子来侍立在耶和华面前，撒但也来在其中。


伯1:7
> The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."
>
> 耶和华问撒但说：“你从哪里来？”撒但回答说：“我从地上走来走去，往返而来。”


伯1:8
> Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil."
>
> 耶和华问撒但说：“你曾用心察看我的仆人约伯没有？地上再没有人像他完全正直，敬畏　神，远离恶事。”


伯1:9
> "Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied.
>
> 撒但回答耶和华说：“约伯敬畏　神岂是无故呢？


伯1:10
> "Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.
>
> 你岂不是四面圈上篱笆围护他和他的家，并他一切所有的吗？他手所做的都蒙你赐福；他的家产也在地上增多。


伯1:11
> But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."
>
> 你且伸手毁他一切所有的，他必当面弃掉你。”


伯1:12
> The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.
>
> 耶和华对撒但说：“凡他所有的都在你手中，只是不可伸手加害于他。”于是撒但从耶和华面前退去。

>
> 示巴人忽然闯来，把牲畜掳去，并用刀杀了仆人；惟有我一人逃脱，来报信给你。”


伯1:16
> While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
>
> 他还说话的时候，又有人来说：“　神从天上降下火来，将群羊和仆人都烧灭了；惟有我一人逃脱，来报信给你。”


伯1:17
> While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
>
> 他还说话的时候，又有人来说：“迦勒底人分作三队，忽然闯来，把骆驼掳去，并用刀杀了仆人；惟有我一人逃脱，来报信给你。”


伯1:18
> While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, "Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,
>
> 他还说话的时候，又有人来说：“你的儿女正在他们长兄的家里吃饭喝酒，


伯1:19
> when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
>
> 不料有狂风从旷野刮来，击打房屋的四角，房屋倒塌在少年人身上，他们就都死了；惟有我一人逃脱，来报信给你。”


伯1:20
> At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship
>
> 约伯便起来，撕裂外袍，剃了头，伏在地上下拜，


伯1:21
> and said: "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised."
>
> 说：“我赤身出于母胎，也必赤身归回。赏赐的是耶和华，收取的也是耶和华。耶和华的名是应当称颂的。”


伯1:22
> In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.
>
> 在这一切的事上，约伯并不犯罪，也不以　神为愚妄（或作“也不妄评　神”）。


## 约伯记第2章
伯2:1
> On another day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them to present himself before him.
>
> 又有一天，　神的众子来侍立在耶和华面前，撒但也来在其中。


伯2:2
> And the LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."
>
> 耶和华问撒但说：“你从哪里来？”撒但回答说：“我从地上走来走去，往返而来。”


伯2:3
> Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason."
>
> 耶和华问撒但说：“你曾用心察看我的仆人约伯没有？地上再没有人像他完全正直，敬畏　神，远离恶事。你虽激动我攻击他，无故地毁灭他；他仍然持守他的纯正。”


伯2:4
> "Skin for skin!" Satan replied. "A man will give all he has for his own life.
>
> 撒但回答耶和华说：“人以皮代皮，情愿舍去一切所有的保全性命。


伯2:5
> But stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face."
>
> 你且伸手伤他的骨头和他的肉，他必当面弃掉你。”


伯2:6
> The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life."
>
> 耶和华对撒但说：“他在你手中，只要存留他的性命。”


伯2:7
> So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.
>
> 于是撒但从耶和华面前退去，击打约伯，使他从脚掌到头顶长毒疮。


伯2:8
> Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.
>
> 约伯就坐在炉灰中，拿瓦片刮身体。


伯2:9
> His wife said to him, "Are you still holding on to your integrity? Curse God and die!"
>
> 他的妻子对他说：“你仍然持守你的纯正吗？你弃掉　神，死了吧！”


伯2:10
> He replied, "You are talking like a foolish woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?" In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.
>
> 约伯却对她说：“你说话像愚顽的妇人一样。嗳！难道我们从　神手里得福，不也受祸吗？”在这一切的事上，约伯并不以口犯罪。


伯2:11
> When Job's three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him.
>
> 约伯的三个朋友，提幔人以利法、书亚人比勒达、拿玛人琐法，听说有这一切的灾祸临到他身上，各人就从本处约会同来，为他悲伤，安慰他。


伯2:12
> When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.
>
> 他们远远地举目观看，认不出他来，就放声大哭。各人撕裂外袍，把尘土向天扬起来，落在自己的头上。


伯2:13
> Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.
>

伯3:2
> He said:
>
> 说：“愿我生的那日


伯3:3
> "May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, 'A boy is born!'
>
> 和说怀了男胎的那夜，都灭没。


伯3:4
> That day--may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine upon it.
>
> 愿那日变为黑暗；愿　神不从上面寻找它，愿亮光不照于其上。


伯3:5
> May darkness and deep shadow claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm its light.
>
> 愿黑暗和死荫索取那日，愿密云停在其上，愿日蚀恐吓它。


伯3:6
> That night--may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.
