> 亚达薛西王二十年尼散月，在王面前摆酒，我拿起酒来奉给王。我素来在王面前没有愁容。


尼2:2
> so the king asked me, "Why does your face look so sad when you are not ill? This can be nothing but sadness of heart." I was very much afraid,
>
> 王对我说：“你既没有病，为什么面带愁容呢？这不是别的，必是你心中愁烦。”于是我甚惧怕。


尼2:3
> but I said to the king, "May the king live forever! Why should my face not look sad when the city where my fathers are buried lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?"
>
> 我对王说：“愿王万岁！我列祖坟墓所在的那城荒凉，城门被火焚烧，我岂能面无愁容吗？”


尼2:4
> The king said to me, "What is it you want?" Then I prayed to the God of heaven,
>
> 王问我说：“你要求什么？”于是我默祷天上的　神。


尼2:5
> and I answered the king, "If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in his sight, let him send me to the city in Judah where my fathers are buried so that I can rebuild it."
>
> 我对王说：“仆人若在王眼前蒙恩，王若喜欢，求王差遣我往犹大，到我列祖坟墓所在的那城去，我好重新建造。”


尼2:6

>
> 那时，王后坐在王的旁边。王问我说：“你去要多少日子？几时回来？”我就定了日期。于是王喜欢差遣我去。

>
> 我又对王说：“王若喜欢，求王赐我诏书，通知大河西的省长准我经过，直到犹大；


尼2:8
> And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper of the king's forest, so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple and for the city wall and for the residence I will occupy?" And because the gracious hand of my God was upon me, the king granted my requests.
>
> 又赐诏书，通知管理王园林的亚萨，使他给我木料，作属殿营楼之门的横梁和城墙，与我自己房屋使用的。”王就允准我，因我　神施恩的手帮助我。

>

尼2:12
> I set out during the night with a few men. I had not told anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no mounts with me except the one I was riding on.
>
> 我夜间起来，有几个人也一同起来；但　神使我心里要为耶路撒冷做什么事，我并没有告诉人。除了我骑的牲口以外，也没有别的牲口在我那里。


尼2:13
> By night I went out through the Valley Gate toward the Jackal Well and the Dung Gate, examining the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken down, and its gates, which had been destroyed by fire.
>
> 当夜，我出了谷门，往野狗井去（“野狗”或作“龙”），到了粪厂门，察看耶路撒冷的城墙，见城墙拆毁，城门被火焚烧。


尼2:14
> Then I moved on toward the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool, but there was not enough room for my mount to get through;
>

> so I went up the valley by night, examining the wall. Finally, I turned back and reentered through the Valley Gate.
>
> 于是，夜间沿溪而上，察看城墙，又转身进入谷门，就回来了。

> The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because as yet I had said nothing to the Jews or the priests or nobles or officials or any others who would be doing the work.
>
> 我往哪里去，我做什么事，官长都不知道。我还没有告诉犹大平民、祭司、贵胄、官长和其余做工的人。

>
> 以后，我对他们说：“我们所遭的难，耶路撒冷怎样荒凉，城门被火焚烧，你们都看见了。来吧！我们重建耶路撒冷的城墙，免得再受凌辱。”

>
> 我告诉他们我　神施恩的手怎样帮助我，并王对我所说的话。他们就说：“我们起来建造吧！”于是他们奋勇做这善工。


尼2:19
> But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked and ridiculed us. "What is this you are doing?" they asked. "Are you rebelling against the king?"
>
> 但和伦人参巴拉，并为奴的亚扪人多比雅和阿拉伯人基善听见就嗤笑我们，藐视我们说：“你们做什么呢？要背叛王吗？”


尼2:20
> I answered them by saying, "The God of heaven will give us success. We his servants will start rebuilding, but as for you, you have no share in Jerusalem or any claim or historic right to it."
>

>
> 我听见他们呼号，说这些话，便甚发怒。

>
> 我对他们说：“我们尽力赎回我们弟兄，就是卖与外邦的犹大人；你们还要卖弟兄，使我们赎回来吗？”他们就静默不语，无话可答。

>
> 我又说：“你们所行的不善！你们行事不当敬畏我们的　神吗？不然，难免我们的仇敌外邦人毁谤我们。

>
> 如今我劝你们将他们的田地、葡萄园、橄榄园、房屋，并向他们所取的银钱、粮食、新酒和油，百分之一的利息都归还他们。”


尼5:12
> "We will give it back," they said. "And we will not demand anything more from them. We will do as you say." Then I summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials take an oath to do what they had promised.
>
> 众人说：“我们必归还，不再向他们索要，必照你的话行。”我就召了祭司来，叫众人起誓，必照着所应许的而行。


尼5:13
> I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, "In this way may God shake out of his house and possessions every man who does not keep this promise. So may such a man be shaken out and emptied!" At this the whole assembly said, "Amen," and praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised.
>
> 我也抖着胸前的衣襟说：“凡不成就这应许的，愿　神照样抖他离开家产和他劳碌得来的，直到抖空了。”会众都说：“阿们！”又赞美耶和华。百姓就照着所应许的去行。


尼5:14
> Moreover, from the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, until his thirty-second year--twelve years--neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor.
>
> 自从我奉派作犹大地的省长，就是从亚达薛西王二十年直到三十二年，共十二年之久，我与我弟兄都没有吃省长的俸禄。


尼5:15
> But the earlier governors--those preceding me--placed a heavy burden on the people and took forty shekels of silver from them in addition to food and wine. Their assistants also lorded it over the people. But out of reverence for God I did not act like that.
>
> 在我以前的省长，加重百姓的担子，每日索要粮食和酒，并银子四十舍客勒，就是他们的仆人也辖制百姓；但我因敬畏　神，不这样行。


尼5:16
> Instead, I devoted myself to the work on this wall. All my men were assembled there for the work; we did not acquire any land.
>
> 并且我恒心修造城墙，并没有置买田地，我的仆人也都聚集在那里做工。


尼5:17
> Furthermore, a hundred and fifty Jews and officials ate at my table, as well as those who came to us from the surrounding nations.
>
> 除了从四围外邦中来的犹大人以外，有犹大平民和官长一百五十人在我席上吃饭。


尼5:18
> Each day one ox, six choice sheep and some poultry were prepared for me, and every ten days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds. In spite of all this, I never demanded the food allotted to the governor, because the demands were heavy on these people.
>
> 每日预备一只公牛、六只肥羊，又预备些飞禽，每十日一次，多预备各样的酒。虽然如此，我并不要省长的俸禄，因为百姓服役甚重。


尼5:19
> Remember me with favor, O my God, for all I have done for these people.
>
> 我的　神啊，求你记念我为这百姓所行的一切事，施恩与我。


## 尼希米记第6章
尼6:1
> When word came to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it--though up to that time I had not set the doors in the gates--
>
> 参巴拉、多比雅、亚拉伯人基善和我们其余的仇敌，听见我已经修完了城墙，其中没有破裂之处（那时我还没有安门扇）。


尼6:2
> Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: "Come, let us meet together in one of the villages on the plain of Ono." But they were scheming to harm me;
>
> 参巴拉和基善就打发人来见我说：“请你来，我们在阿挪平原的一个村庄相会。”他们却想害我。


尼6:3
> so I sent messengers to them with this reply: "I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?"
>
> 于是，我差遣人去见他们说：“我现在办理大工，不能下去！焉能停工，下去见你们呢？”


尼6:4
> Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave them the same answer.
>
> 他们这样四次打发人来见我，我都如此回答他们。


尼6:5
> Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent his aide to me with the same message, and in his hand was an unsealed letter
>
> 参巴拉第五次打发仆人来见我，手里拿着未封的信，


尼6:6
> in which was written: "It is reported among the nations--and Geshem says it is true--that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and therefore you are building the wall. Moreover, according to these reports you are about to become their king
>
> 信上写着说：“外邦人中有风声，迦施慕（就是“基善”，见2章19节）也说，你和犹大人谋反，修造城墙，你要作他们的王。


尼6:7
> and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem: 'There is a king in Judah!' Now this report will get back to the king; so come, let us confer together."
>
> 你又派先知在耶路撒冷指着你宣讲说：‘在犹大有王。’现在这话必传与王知，所以请你来，与我们彼此商议。”


尼6:8
> I sent him this reply: "Nothing like what you are saying is happening; you are just making it up out of your head."
>
> 我就差遣人去见他说：“你所说的这事，一概没有，是你心里捏造的。”


尼6:9
> They were all trying to frighten us, thinking, "Their hands will get too weak for the work, and it will not be completed." But I prayed,"Now strengthen my hands."
>
> 他们都要使我们惧怕，意思说：“他们的手必软弱，以致工作不能成就。”“　神啊，求你坚固我的手。”


尼6:10
> One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home. He said, "Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the temple doors, because men are coming to kill you--by night they are coming to kill you."
>
> 我到了米希大别的孙子、第来雅的儿子示玛雅家里。那时，他闭门不出。他说：“我们不如在　神的殿里会面，将殿门关锁，因为他们要来杀你，就是夜里来杀你。”


尼6:11
> But I said, "Should a man like me run away? Or should one like me go into the temple to save his life? I will not go!"
>
> 我说：“像我这样的人，岂要逃跑呢？像我这样的人，岂能进入殿里保全生命呢？我不进去！”


尼6:12
> I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
>
> 我看明　神没有差遣他，是他自己说这话攻击我，是多比雅和参巴拉贿买了他。


尼6:13
> He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing this, and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me.
>
> 贿买他的缘故，是要叫我惧怕，依从他犯罪，他们好传扬恶言毁谤我。


尼6:14
> Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, O my God, because of what they have done; remember also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who have been trying to intimidate me.
>
> 我的　神啊！多比雅、参巴拉、女先知挪亚底和其余的先知，要叫我惧怕，求你记念他们所行的这些事。


尼6:15
> So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days.
>
> 以禄月二十五日，城墙修完了，共修了五十二天。


尼6:16
> When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self-confidence, because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our God.
>
> 我们一切仇敌，四围的外邦人，听见了便惧怕，愁眉不展，因为见这工作完成，是出乎我们的　神。


尼6:17
> Also, in those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah, and replies from Tobiah kept coming to them.
>
> 在那些日子，犹大的贵胄屡次寄信与多比雅，多比雅也来信与他们。


尼6:18
> For many in Judah were under oath to him, since he was son-in-law to Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah.
>
> 在犹大有许多人与多比雅结盟，因他是亚拉的儿子、示迦尼的女婿，并且他的儿子约哈难娶了比利迦儿子米书兰的女儿为妻。


尼6:19
> Moreover, they kept reporting to me his good deeds and then telling him what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.
>
> 他们常在我面前说多比雅的善行，也将我的话传与他。多比雅又常寄信来，要叫我惧怕。


## 尼希米记第7章
尼7:1
> After the wall had been rebuilt and I had set the doors in place, the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed.
>
> 城墙修完，我安了门扇，守门的、歌唱的和利未人都已派定。


尼7:2
> I put in charge of Jerusalem my brother Hanani, along with Hananiah the commander of the citadel, because he was a man of integrity and feared God more than most men do.
>
> 我就派我的弟兄哈拿尼和营楼的宰官哈拿尼雅管理耶路撒冷。因为哈拿尼雅是忠信的，又敬畏　神过于众人。


尼7:3
> I said to them, "The gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until the sun is hot. While the gatekeepers are still on duty, have them shut the doors and bar them. Also appoint residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at their posts and some near their own houses."
>
> 我吩咐他们说：“等到太阳上升，才可开耶路撒冷的城门；人尚看守的时候，就要关门上闩。也当派耶路撒冷的居民各按班次，看守自己房屋对面之处。”


尼7:4
> Now the city was large and spacious, but there were few people in it, and the houses had not yet been rebuilt.
>
> 城是广大，其中的民却稀少，房屋还没有建造。


尼7:5
> So my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials and the common people for registration by families. I found the genealogical record of those who had been the first to return. This is what I found written there:
>
> 我的　神感动我心，招聚贵胄、官长和百姓，要照家谱计算。我找着第一次上来之人的家谱，其上写着：


尼7:6
> These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken captive (they returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own town,
