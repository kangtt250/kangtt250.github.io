This week I came down with a cold so I didn't get as much done as I would have liked.
My tasks for this week were to continue working on the character design and to implement simple player movement for testing purposes.

## Player Movement
This week I mainly focused on Player Movement. 
We wanted the player to have two move speeds, a slow buildup walk speed, and an explosively quick sprint speed.
We also wanted to make use of Unity's built in physics component for 2D.
While testing we ran into a few errors with how the player interacted with the tileset at high speeds, so we need to continue tweaking the character's maximum speeds for a while.
