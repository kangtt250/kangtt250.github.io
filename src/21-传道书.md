传1:8
> All things are wearisome, more than one can say. The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing.
>
> 万事令人厌烦（或作“万物满有困乏”），人不能说尽。眼看，看不饱；耳听，听不足。


传1:9
> What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.
>
> 已有的事，后必再有；已行的事，后必再行。日光之下，并无新事。

>
> 我心里察究，如何用酒使我肉体舒畅，我心却仍以智慧引导我；又如何持住愚昧，等我看明世人，在天下一生当行何事为美。


传2:4
> I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards.
>
> 我为自己动大工程，建造房屋，栽种葡萄园；


传2:5
> I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.
>
> 修造园囿，在其中栽种各样果木树；

>
> 后来，我察看我手所经营的一切事和我劳碌所成的功，谁知都是虚空，都是捕风，在日光之下毫无益处。


传2:12
> Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom, and also madness and folly. What more can the king's successor do than what has already been done?
>
> 我转念观看智慧、狂妄和愚昧。在王以后而来的人还能做什么呢？也不过行早先所行的就是了。


传2:13
> I saw that wisdom is better than folly, just as light is better than darkness.
>
> 我便看出智慧胜过愚昧，如同光明胜过黑暗。


传2:14
> The wise man has eyes in his head, while the fool walks in the darkness; but I came to realize that the same fate overtakes them both.
>
> 智慧人的眼目光明（原文作“在他头上”）；愚昧人在黑暗里行。我却看明有一件事，这两等人都必遇见。


传2:15
> Then I thought in my heart, "The fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise?" I said in my heart, "This too is meaningless."
>
> 我就心里说：“愚昧人所遇见的，我也必遇见，我为何更有智慧呢？”我心里说：“这也是虚空。”

> 我恨恶一切的劳碌，就是我在日光之下的劳碌，因为我得来的必留给我以后的人。


传2:19
> And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the work into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.
>
> 那人是智慧是愚昧，谁能知道？他竟要管理我劳碌所得的，就是我在日光之下用智慧所得的。这也是虚空。


传2:20
> So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun.
>
> 故此，我转想我在日光之下所劳碌的一切工作，心便绝望。


传2:21
> For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then he must leave all he owns to someone who has not worked for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.
>
> 因为有人用智慧、知识、灵巧所劳碌得来的，却要留给未曾劳碌的人为分。这也是虚空，也是大患！

>
> 人莫强如吃喝，且在劳碌中享福，我看这也是出于　神的手。


传2:25
> for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?
>
> 论到吃用、享福，谁能胜过我呢？


传2:26
> To the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
>
> 神喜悦谁，就给谁智慧、知识和喜乐，惟有罪人，　神使他劳苦，叫他将所收聚的、所堆积的归给　神所喜悦的人。这也是虚空，也是捕风。

> And I saw something else under the sun: In the place of judgment--wickedness was there, in the place of justice--wickedness was there.
>

> 罪人虽然作恶百次，倒享长久的年日。然而我准知道，敬畏　神的，就是在他面前敬畏的人，终久必得福乐。


传8:13
> Yet because the wicked do not fear God, it will not go well with them, and their days will not lengthen like a shadow.
>
> 恶人却不得福乐，也不得长久的年日；这年日好像影儿，因他不敬畏　神。


传8:14
> There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth: righteous men who get what the wicked deserve, and wicked men who get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless.
>
> 世上有一件虚空的事，就是义人所遭遇的，反照恶人所行的；又有恶人所遭遇的，反照义人所行的。我说，这也是虚空。

>
> 我专心求智慧，要看世上所做的事。（有昼夜不睡觉，不合眼的。）


传8:17
> then I saw all that God has done. No one can comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all his efforts to search it out, man cannot discover its meaning. Even if a wise man claims he knows, he cannot really comprehend it.
>
> 我就看明　神一切的作为，知道人查不出日光之下所做的事；任凭他费多少力寻查，都查不出来，就是智慧人虽想知道，也是查不出来。

>
> 我将这一切事放在心上，详细考究，就知道义人和智慧人并他们的作为都在　神手中；或是爱或是恨，都在他们的前面，人不能知道。


传9:2
> All share a common destiny--the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who do not. As it is with the good man, so with the sinner; as it is with those who take oaths, so with those who are afraid to take them.
>
> 凡临到众人的事都是一样：义人和恶人都遭遇一样的事；好人、洁净人和不洁净人、献祭的与不献祭的，也是一样。好人如何，罪人也如何；起誓的如何，怕起誓的也如何。


传9:3
> This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun: The same destiny overtakes all. The hearts of men, moreover, are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterward they join the dead.
>
> 在日光之下所行的一切事上，有一件祸患，就是众人所遭遇的都是一样，并且世人的心充满了恶。活着的时候心里狂妄，后来就归死人那里去了。

> Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your head with oil.
>
> 你的衣服当时常洁白，你头上也不要缺少膏油。


传9:9
> Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun--all your meaningless days. For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun.
>
> 在你一生虚空的年日，就是　神赐你在日光之下虚空的年日，当同你所爱的妻快活度日，因为那是你生前在日光之下劳碌的事上所得的分。


传9:10
> Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the grave, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.
>
> 凡你手所当做的事，要尽力去做，因为在你所必去的阴间，没有工作，没有谋算，没有知识，也没有智慧。


传9:11
> I have seen something else under the sun: The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all.
>
> 我又转念，见日光之下，快跑的未必能赢；力战的未必得胜；智慧的未必得粮食，明哲的未必得资财，灵巧的未必得喜悦；所临到众人的，是在乎当时的机会。


传9:12
> Moreover, no man knows when his hour will come: As fish are caught in a cruel net, or birds are taken in a snare, so men are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly upon them.
>
> 原来人也不知道自己的定期，鱼被恶网圈住，鸟被网罗捉住，祸患忽然临到的时候，世人陷在其中，也是如此。


传9:13
> I also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that greatly impressed me:
>
> 我见日光之下有一样智慧，据我看乃是广大。


传9:14
> There was once a small city with only a few people in it. And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge siegeworks against it.
>
> 就是有一小城，其中的人数稀少，有大君王来攻击，修筑营垒，将城围困。


传9:15
> Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man.
>
> 城中有一个贫穷的智慧人，他用智慧救了那城，却没有人记念那穷人。


传9:16
> So I said, "Wisdom is better than strength." But the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are no longer heeded.
>
> 我就说：“智慧胜过勇力。”然而那贫穷人的智慧被人藐视，他的话也无人听从。
