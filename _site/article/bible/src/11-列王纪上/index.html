She can lie beside him so that our lord the king may keep warm.”<p>所以臣仆对他说：“不如为我主我王寻找一个处女，使她伺候王，奉养王，睡在王的怀中，好叫我主我王得暖。”</blockquote><p>王上1:3<blockquote><p>Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful girl and found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.<p>于是，在以色列全境寻找美貌的童女，寻得书念的一个童女亚比煞，就带到王那里。</blockquote><p>王上1:4<blockquote><p>The girl was very beautiful; she took care of the king and waited on him, but the king had no intimate relations with her.<p>这童女极其美貌，她奉养王，伺候王，王却没有与她亲近。</blockquote><p>王上1:5<blockquote><p>Now Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, put himself forward and said, “I will be king.” So he got chariots and horses ready, with fifty men to run ahead of him.<p>那时，哈及的儿子亚多尼雅自尊，说：“我必作王。”就为自己预备车辆、马兵，又派五十人在他前头奔走。</blockquote><p>王上1:6<blockquote><p>(His father had never interfered with him by asking, “Why do you behave as you do?” He was also very handsome and was born next after Absalom.)<p>他父亲素来没有使他忧闷，说：“你是做什么呢？”他甚俊美，生在押沙龙之后。</blockquote><p>王上1:7<blockquote><p>Adonijah conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they gave him their support.<p>亚多尼雅与洗鲁雅的儿子约押和祭司亚比亚他商议，二人就顺从他，帮助他。</blockquote><p>王上1:8<blockquote><p>But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei and Rei and David’s special guard did not join Adonijah.<p>但祭司撒督、耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅、先知拿单、示每、利以并大卫的勇士，都不顺从亚多尼雅。</blockquote><p>王上1:9<blockquote><p>Adonijah then sacrificed sheep, cattle and fattened calves at the Stone of Zoheleth near En Rogel. He invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah who were royal officials,<p>一日，亚多尼雅在隐罗结旁、琐希列磐石那里，宰了牛羊、肥犊，请他的诸弟兄，就是王的众子，并所有作王臣仆的犹大人；</blockquote><p>王上1:10<blockquote><p>but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the special guard or his brother Solomon.<p>惟独先知拿单和比拿雅并勇士，与他的兄弟所罗门，他都没有请。</blockquote><p>王上1:11<blockquote><p>Then Nathan asked Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother, “Have you not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has become king without our lord David’s knowing it?<p>拿单对所罗门的母亲拔示巴说：“哈及的儿子亚多尼雅作王了，你没有听见吗？我们的主大卫却不知道。</blockquote><p>王上1:12<blockquote><p>Now then, let me advise you how you can save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.<p>现在我可以给你出个主意，好保全你和你儿子所罗门的性命。</blockquote><p>王上1:13<blockquote><p>Go in to King David and say to him, ‘My lord the king, did you not swear to me your servant: “Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne”? Why then has Adonijah become king?’<p>你进去见大卫王，对他说：‘我主我王啊，你不曾向婢女起誓说：你儿子所罗门必接续我作王，坐在我的位上吗？现在亚多尼雅怎么作了王呢？’</blockquote><p>王上1:14<blockquote><p>While you are still there talking to the king, I will come in and confirm what you have said.”<p>你还与王说话的时候，我也随后进去，证实你的话。”</blockquote><p>王上1:15<blockquote><p>So Bathsheba went to see the aged king in his room, where Abishag the Shunammite was attending him.<p>拔示巴进入内室见王，王甚老迈，书念的童女亚比煞正伺候王。</blockquote><p>王上1:16<blockquote><p>Bathsheba bowed low and knelt before the king. “What is it you want?” the king asked.<p>拔示巴向王屈身下拜。王说：“你要什么？”</blockquote><p>王上1:17<blockquote><p>She said to him, “My lord, you yourself swore to me your servant by the LORD your God: ‘Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne.’<p>她说：“我主啊，你曾向婢女指着耶和华你的　神起誓说：‘你儿子所罗门必接续我作王，坐在我的位上。’</blockquote><p>王上1:18<blockquote><p>But now Adonijah has become king, and you, my lord the king, do not know about it.<p>现在亚多尼雅作王了，我主我王却不知道。</blockquote><p>王上1:19<blockquote><p>He has sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep, and has invited all the king’s sons, Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army, but he has not invited Solomon your servant.<p>他宰了许多牛羊、肥犊，请了王的众子和祭司亚比亚他，并元帅约押；惟独王的仆人所罗门，他没有请。</blockquote><p>王上1:20<blockquote><p>My lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to learn from you who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.<p>我主我王啊，以色列众人的眼目都仰望你，等你晓谕他们，在我主我王之后，谁坐你的位。</blockquote><p>王上1:21<blockquote><p>Otherwise, as soon as my lord the king is laid to rest with his fathers, I and my son Solomon will be treated as criminals.”<p>若不然，到我主我王与列祖同睡以后，我和我儿子所罗门必算为罪人了。”</blockquote><p>王上1:22<blockquote><p>While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived.<p>拔示巴还与王说话的时候，先知拿单也进来了。</blockquote><p>王上1:23<blockquote><p>And they told the king, “Nathan the prophet is here.” So he went before the king and bowed with his face to the ground.<p>有人奏告王说：“先知拿单来了。”拿单进到王前，脸伏于地。</blockquote><p>王上1:24<blockquote><p>Nathan said, “Have you, my lord the king, declared that Adonijah shall be king after you, and that he will sit on your throne?<p>拿单说：“我主我王果然应许亚多尼雅说：‘你必接续我作王，坐在我的位上’吗？</blockquote><p>王上1:25<blockquote><p>Today he has gone down and sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep. He has invited all the king’s sons, the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest. Right now they are eating and drinking with him and saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’<p>他今日下去，宰了许多牛羊、肥犊，请了王的众子和军长，并祭司亚比亚他，他们正在亚多尼雅面前吃喝，说：‘愿亚多尼雅王万岁！’</blockquote><p>王上1:26<blockquote><p>But me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon he did not invite.<p>惟独我，就是你的仆人和祭司撒督，耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅，并王的仆人所罗门，他都没有请。</blockquote><p>王上1:27<blockquote><p>Is this something my lord the king has done without letting his servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”<p>这事果然出乎我主我王吗？王却没有告诉仆人们，在我主我王之后，谁坐你的位。”</blockquote><p>王上1:28<blockquote><p>Then King David said, “Call in Bathsheba.” So she came into the king’s presence and stood before him.<p>大卫王吩咐说：“叫拔示巴来。”拔示巴就进来站在王面前。</blockquote><p>王上1:29<blockquote><p>The king then took an oath: “As surely as the LORD lives, who has delivered me out of every trouble,<p>王起誓说：“我指着救我性命脱离一切苦难，永生的耶和华起誓。</blockquote><p>王上1:30<blockquote><p>I will surely carry out today what I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel: Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne in my place.”<p>我既然指着耶和华以色列的　神向你起誓说：‘你儿子所罗门必接续我作王，坐在我的位上。’我今日就必照这话而行。”</blockquote><p>王上1:31<blockquote><p>Then Bathsheba bowed low with her face to the ground and, kneeling before the king, said, “May my lord King David live forever!”<p>于是拔示巴脸伏于地，向王下拜，说：“愿我主大卫王万岁！”</blockquote><p>王上1:32<blockquote><p>King David said, “Call in Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet and Benaiah son of Jehoiada.” When they came before the king,<p>大卫王又吩咐说：“将祭司撒督、先知拿单、耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅召来。”他们就都来到王面前。</blockquote><p>王上1:33<blockquote><p>he said to them: “Take your lord’s servants with you and set Solomon my son on my own mule and take him down to Gihon.<p>王对他们说：“要带领你们主的仆人，使我儿子所罗门骑我的骡子，送他下到基训。</blockquote><p>王上1:34<blockquote><p>There have Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel. Blow the trumpet and shout, ‘Long live King Solomon!’<p>在那里，祭司撒督和先知拿单要膏他作以色列的王。你们也要吹角，说：‘愿所罗门王万岁！’</blockquote><p>王上1:35<blockquote><p>Then you are to go up with him, and he is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place. I have appointed him ruler over Israel and Judah.”<p>然后要跟随他上来，使他坐在我的位上，接续我作王。我已立他作以色列和犹大的君。”</blockquote><p>王上1:36<blockquote><p>Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king, “Amen! May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, so declare it.<p>耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅对王说：“阿们！愿耶和华我主我王的　神也这样命定。</blockquote><p>王上1:37<blockquote><p>As the LORD was with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon to make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord King David!”<p>耶和华怎样与我主我王同在，愿他照样与所罗门同在，使他的国位比我主大卫王的国位更大。”</blockquote><p>王上1:38<blockquote><p>So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites went down and put Solomon on King David’s mule and escorted him to Gihon.<p>于是，祭司撒督、先知拿单、耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅和基利提人、比利提人，都下去使所罗门骑大卫王的骡子，将他送到基训。</blockquote><p>王上1:39<blockquote><p>Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the sacred tent and anointed Solomon. Then they sounded the trumpet and all the people shouted, “Long live King Solomon!”<p>祭司撒督就从帐幕中取了盛膏油的角来，用膏膏所罗门。人就吹角，众民都说：“愿所罗门王万岁！”</blockquote><p>王上1:40<blockquote><p>And all the people went up after him, playing flutes and rejoicing greatly, so that the ground shook with the sound.<p>众民跟随他上来，且吹笛，大大欢呼，声音震地。</blockquote><p>王上1:41<blockquote><p>Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they were finishing their feast. On hearing the sound of the trumpet, Joab asked, “What’s the meaning of all the noise in the city?”<p>亚多尼雅和所请的众客筵宴方毕，听见这声音。约押听见角声，就说：“城中为何有这响声呢？”</blockquote><p>王上1:42<blockquote><p>Even as he was speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. Adonijah said, “Come in. A worthy man like you must be bringing good news.”<p>他正说话的时候，祭司亚比亚他的儿子约拿单来了。亚多尼雅对他说：“进来吧！你是个忠义的人，必是报好信息。”</blockquote><p>王上1:43<blockquote><p>“Not at all!” Jonathan answered. “Our lord King David has made Solomon king.<p>约拿单对亚多尼雅说：“我们的主大卫王诚然立所罗门为王了。</blockquote><p>王上1:44<blockquote><p>The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and they have put him on the king’s mule,<p>王差遣祭司撒督、先知拿单、耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅和基利提人、比利提人都去使所罗门骑王的骡子。</blockquote><p>王上1:45<blockquote><p>and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon. From there they have gone up cheering, and the city resounds with it. That’s the noise you hear.<p>祭司撒督和先知拿单在基训已经膏他作王。众人都从那里欢呼着上来，声音使城震动，这就是你们所听见的声音。</blockquote><p>王上1:46<blockquote><p>Moreover, Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne.<p>并且所罗门登了国位。</blockquote><p>王上1:47<blockquote><p>Also, the royal officials have come to congratulate our lord King David, saying, ‘May your God make Solomon’s name more famous than yours and his throne greater than yours!’ And the king bowed in worship on his bed<p>王的臣仆也来为我们的主大卫王祝福说：‘愿王的　神使所罗门的名比王的名更尊荣，使他的国位比王的国位更大。’王就在床上屈身下拜。</blockquote><p>王上1:48<blockquote><p>and said, ‘Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has allowed my eyes to see a successor on my throne today.’”<p>王又说：‘耶和华以色列的　神是应当称颂的！因他赐我一人今日坐在我的位上，我也亲眼看见了。’”</blockquote><p>王上1:49<blockquote><p>At this, all Adonijah’s guests rose in alarm and dispersed.<p>亚多尼雅的众客听见这话就都惊惧，起来四散。</blockquote><p>王上1:50<blockquote><p>But Adonijah, in fear of Solomon, went and took hold of the horns of the altar.<p>亚多尼雅惧怕所罗门，就起来，去抓住祭坛的角。</blockquote><p>王上1:51<blockquote><p>Then Solomon was told, “Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon and is clinging to the horns of the altar. He says, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.’”<p>有人告诉所罗门说：“亚多尼雅惧怕所罗门王，现在抓住祭坛的角说：‘愿所罗门王今日向我起誓，必不用刀杀仆人。’”</blockquote><p>王上1:52<blockquote><p>Solomon replied, “If he shows himself to be a worthy man, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground; but if evil is found in him, he will die.”<p>所罗门说：“他若作忠义的人，连一根头皮也不至落在地上；他若行恶，必要死亡。”</blockquote><p>王上1:53<blockquote><p>Then King Solomon sent men, and they brought him down from the altar. And Adonijah came and bowed down to King Solomon, and Solomon said, “Go to your home.”<p>于是，所罗门王差遣人，使亚多尼雅从坛上下来，他就来向所罗门王下拜。所罗门对他说：“你回家去吧！”</blockquote><h2 id="列王纪上第2章">列王纪上第2章</h2><p>王上2:1<blockquote><p>When the time drew near for David to die, he gave a charge to Solomon his son.<p>大卫的死期临近了，就嘱咐他儿子所罗门说：</blockquote><p>王上2:2<blockquote><p>“I am about to go the way of all the earth,” he said. “So be strong, show yourself a man,<p>“我现在要走世人必走的路，所以你当刚强，作大丈夫，</blockquote><p>王上2:3<blockquote><p>and observe what the LORD your God requires: Walk in his ways, and keep his decrees and commands, his laws and requirements, as written in the Law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you go,<p>遵守耶和华你　神所吩咐的，照着摩西律法上所写的行主的道，谨守他的律例、诫命、典章、法度。这样，你无论做什么事，不拘往何处去，尽都亨通。</blockquote><p>王上2:4<blockquote><p>and that the LORD may keep his promise to me: ‘If your descendants watch how they live, and if they walk faithfully before me with all their heart and soul, you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.’<p>耶和华必成就向我所应许的话说：‘你的子孙若谨慎自己的行为，尽心尽意、诚诚实实地行在我面前，就不断人坐以色列的国位。’</blockquote><p>王上2:5<blockquote><p>“Now you yourself know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me–what he did to the two commanders of Israel’s armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He killed them, shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle, and with that blood stained the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet.<p>你知道洗鲁雅的儿子约押向我所行的，就是杀了以色列的两个元帅：尼珥的儿子押尼珥和益帖的儿子亚玛撒。他在太平之时流这二人的血，如在争战之时一样，将这血染了腰间束的带和脚上穿的鞋。</blockquote><p>王上2:6<blockquote><p>Deal with him according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace.<p>所以你要照你的智慧行，不容他白头安然下阴间。</blockquote><p>王上2:7<blockquote><p>“But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table.

You might as well request the kingdom for him–after all, he is my older brother–yes, for him and for Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah!”<p>所罗门王对他母亲说：“为何单替他求书念的女子亚比煞呢？也可以为他求国吧！他是我的哥哥，他有祭司亚比亚他和洗鲁雅的儿子约押为辅佐。”</blockquote><p>王上2:23<blockquote><p>Then King Solomon swore by the LORD: “May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if Adonijah does not pay with his life for this request!<p>所罗门王就指着耶和华起誓说：“亚多尼雅这话是自己送命，不然，愿　神重重地降罚与我。</blockquote><p>王上2:24<blockquote><p>And now, as surely as the LORD lives–he who has established me securely on the throne of my father David and has founded a dynasty for me as he promised–Adonijah shall be put to death today!”<p>耶和华坚立我，使我坐在父亲大卫的位上，照着所应许的话为我建立家室。现在我指着永生的耶和华起誓，亚多尼雅今日必被治死。”</blockquote><p>王上2:25<blockquote><p>So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck down Adonijah and he died.<p>于是，所罗门王差遣耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅将亚多尼雅杀死。</blockquote><p>王上2:26<blockquote><p>To Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go back to your fields in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not put you to death now, because you carried the ark of the Sovereign LORD before my father David and shared all my father’s hardships.”<p>王对祭司亚比亚他说：“你回亚拿突归自己的田地去吧！你本是该死的，但因你在我父亲大卫面前抬过主耶和华的约柜，又与我父亲同受一切苦难，所以我今日不将你杀死。”</blockquote><p>王上2:27<blockquote><p>So Solomon removed Abiathar from the priesthood of the LORD, fulfilling the word the LORD had spoken at Shiloh about the house of Eli.<p>所罗门就革除亚比亚他，不许他作耶和华的祭司。这样，便应验耶和华在示罗论以利家所说的话。</blockquote><p>王上2:28<blockquote><p>When the news reached Joab, who had conspired with Adonijah though not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the LORD and took hold of the horns of the altar.<p>约押虽然没有归从押沙龙，却归从了亚多尼雅。他听见这风声，就逃到耶和华的帐幕，抓住祭坛的角。</blockquote><p>王上2:29<blockquote><p>King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the tent of the LORD and was beside the altar. Then Solomon ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada, “Go, strike him down!”<p>有人告诉所罗门王说：“约押逃到耶和华的帐幕，现今在祭坛的旁边。”所罗门就差遣耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅说：“你去将他杀死。”</blockquote><p>王上2:30<blockquote><p>So Benaiah entered the tent of the LORD and said to Joab, “The king says, ‘Come out!’” But he answered, “No, I will die here.” Benaiah reported to the king, “This is how Joab answered me.”<p>比拿雅来到耶和华的帐幕，对约押说：“王吩咐说：‘你出来吧！’”他说：“我不出去，我要死在这里。”比拿雅就去回覆王，说约押如此如此回答我。</blockquote><p>王上2:31<blockquote><p>Then the king commanded Benaiah, “Do as he says. Strike him down and bury him, and so clear me and my father’s house of the guilt of the innocent blood that Joab shed.<p>王说：“你可以照着他的话行，杀死他，将他葬埋，好叫约押流无辜人血的罪不归我和我的父家了。</blockquote><p>王上2:32<blockquote><p>The LORD will repay him for the blood he shed, because without the knowledge of my father David he attacked two men and killed them with the sword. Both of them–Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel’s army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah’s army–were better men and more upright than he.<p>耶和华必使约押流人血的罪归到他自己的头上，因为他用刀杀了两个比他又义又好的人，就是以色列元帅尼珥的儿子押尼珥和犹大元帅益帖的儿子亚玛撒，我父亲大卫却不知道。</blockquote><p>王上2:33<blockquote><p>May the guilt of their blood rest on the head of Joab and his descendants forever.

I hid a hundred of the LORD’S prophets in two caves, fifty in each, and supplied them with food and water.<p>耶洗别杀耶和华众先知的时候，我将耶和华的一百个先知藏了，每五十人藏在一个洞里，拿饼和水供养他们，岂没有人将这事告诉我主吗?</blockquote><p>王上18:14<blockquote><p>And now you tell me to go to my master and say, ‘Elijah is here.’ He will kill me!”<p>现在你说：‘要去告诉你主人说：以利亚在这里’；他必杀我。”</blockquote><p>王上18:15<blockquote><p>Elijah said, “As the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, I will surely present myself to Ahab today.”<p>以利亚说：“我指着所事奉永生的万军之耶和华起誓，我今日必使亚哈得见我。”</blockquote><p>王上18:16<blockquote><p>So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah.<p>于是，俄巴底去迎着亚哈，告诉他，亚哈就去迎着以利亚。</blockquote><p>王上18:17<blockquote><p>When he saw Elijah, he said to him, “Is that you, you troubler of Israel?”<p>亚哈见了以利亚，便说：“使以色列遭灾的就是你吗?”</blockquote><p>王上18:18<blockquote><p>“I have not made trouble for Israel,” Elijah replied. “But you and your father’s family have. You have abandoned the LORD’S commands and have followed the Baals.<p>以利亚说：“使以色列遭灾的不是我，乃是你和你父家，因为你们离弃耶和华的诫命，去随从巴力。</blockquote><p>王上18:19<blockquote><p>Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. And bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table.”<p>现在你当差遣人，招聚以色列众人和事奉巴力的那四百五十个先知，并耶洗别所供养事奉亚舍拉的那四百个先知，使他们都上迦密山去见我。”</blockquote><p>王上18:20<blockquote><p>So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel.<p>亚哈就差遣人招聚以色列众人和先知都上迦密山。</blockquote><p>王上18:21<blockquote><p>Elijah went before the people and said, “How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him.” But the people said nothing.<p>以利亚前来对众民说：“你们心持两意要到几时呢?若耶和华是　神，就当顺从耶和华；若巴力是　神，就当顺从巴力。”众民一言不答。</blockquote><p>王上18:22<blockquote><p>Then Elijah said to them, “I am the only one of the LORD’S prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets.<p>以利亚对众民说：“作耶和华先知的只剩下我一个人；巴力的先知却有四百五十个人。</blockquote><p>王上18:23<blockquote><p>Get two bulls for us. Let them choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it.<p>当给我们两只牛犊。巴力的先知可以挑选一只，切成块子，放在柴上，不要点火；我也预备一只牛犊，放在柴上，也不点火。</blockquote><p>王上18:24<blockquote><p>Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The god who answers by fire–he is God.” Then all the people said, “What you say is good.”<p>你们求告你们　神的名，我也求告耶和华的名。那降火显应的神，就是　神。”众民回答说：“这话甚好。”</blockquote><p>王上18:25<blockquote><p>Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one of the bulls and prepare it first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire.”<p>以利亚对巴力的先知说：“你们既是人多，当先挑选一只牛犊，预备好了，就求告你们　神的名，却不要点火。”</blockquote><p>王上18:26<blockquote><p>So they took the bull given them and prepared it. Then they called on the name of Baal from morning till noon. “O Baal, answer us!” they shouted. But there was no response; no one answered. And they danced around the altar they had made.<p>他们将所得的牛犊预备好了，从早晨到午间，求告巴力的名说：“巴力啊，求你应允我们!”却没有声音，没有应允的。他们在所筑的坛四围踊跳。</blockquote><p>王上18:27<blockquote><p>At noon Elijah began to taunt them. “Shout louder!” he said. “Surely he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling. Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened.”<p>到了正午，以利亚嬉笑他们说：“大声求告吧！因为他是　神，他或默想，或走到一边，或行路，或睡觉，你们当叫醒他。”</blockquote><p>王上18:28<blockquote><p>So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until their blood flowed.<p>他们大声求告，按着他们的规矩，用刀枪自割自刺，直到身体流血。</blockquote><p>王上18:29<blockquote><p>Midday passed, and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention.<p>从午后直到献晚祭的时候，他们狂呼乱叫，却没有声音，没有应允的，也没有理会的。</blockquote><p>王上18:30<blockquote><p>Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come here to me.” They came to him, and he repaired the altar of the LORD, which was in ruins.<p>以利亚对众民说：“你们到我这里来！”众民就到他那里。他便重修已经毁坏耶和华的坛。</blockquote><p>王上18:31<blockquote><p>Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, “Your name shall be Israel.”<p>以利亚照雅各子孙支派的数目，取了十二块石头（耶和华的话曾临到雅各说：“你的名要叫以色列”），</blockquote><p>王上18:32<blockquote><p>With the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD, and he dug a trench around it large enough to hold two seahs of seed.<p>用这些石头为耶和华的名筑一座坛，在坛的四围挖沟，可容谷种二细亚，</blockquote><p>王上18:33<blockquote><p>He arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces and laid it on the wood. Then he said to them, “Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood.”<p>又在坛上摆好了柴，把牛犊切成块子放在柴上，对众人说：“你们用四个桶盛满水，倒在燔祭和柴上。”</blockquote><p>王上18:34<blockquote><p>“Do it again,” he said, and they did it again. “Do it a third time,” he ordered, and they did it the third time.<p>又说：“倒第二次。”他们就倒第二次。又说：“倒第三次。”他们就倒第三次。</blockquote><p>王上18:35<blockquote><p>The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench.<p>水流在坛的四围，沟里也满了水。</blockquote><p>王上18:36<blockquote><p>At the time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed: “O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command.<p>到了献晚祭的时候，先知以利亚近前来说：“亚伯拉罕、以撒、以色列的　神，耶和华啊！求你今日使人知道你是以色列的　神，也知道我是你的仆人，又是奉你的命行这一切事。</blockquote><p>王上18:37<blockquote><p>Answer me, O LORD, answer me, so these people will know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you are turning their hearts back again.”<p>耶和华啊，求你应允我，应允我！使这民知道你耶和华是　神，又知道是你叫这民的心回转。”</blockquote><p>王上18:38<blockquote><p>Then the fire of the LORD fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench.<p>于是，耶和华降下火来，烧尽燔祭、木柴、石头、尘土，又烧干沟里的水。</blockquote><p>王上18:39<blockquote><p>When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, “The LORD–he is God! The LORD–he is God!”<p>众民看见了，就俯伏在地说：“耶和华是　神！耶和华是　神！”</blockquote><p>王上18:40<blockquote><p>Then Elijah commanded them, “Seize the prophets of Baal. Don’t let anyone get away!” They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there.<p>以利亚对他们说：“拿住巴力的先知，不容一人逃脱！”众人就拿住他们。以利亚带他们到基顺河边，在那里杀了他们。</blockquote><p>王上18:41<blockquote><p>And Elijah said to Ahab, “Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain.”<p>以利亚对亚哈说：“你现在可以上去吃喝，因为有多雨的响声了。”</blockquote><p>王上18:42<blockquote><p>So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees.<p>亚哈就上去吃喝。以利亚上了迦密山顶，屈身在地，将脸伏在两膝之中。</blockquote><p>王上18:43<blockquote><p>“Go and look toward the sea,” he told his servant. And he went up and looked. “There is nothing there,” he said. Seven times Elijah said, “Go back.”<p>对仆人说：“你上去，向海观看。”仆人就上去观看说：“没有什么。”他说：“你再去观看。”如此七次。</blockquote><p>王上18:44<blockquote><p>The seventh time the servant reported, “A cloud as small as a man’s hand is rising from the sea.” So Elijah said, “Go and tell Ahab, ‘Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.’”<p>第七次仆人说：“我看见有一小片云从海里上来，不过如人手那样大。”以利亚说：“你上去告诉亚哈，当套车下去，免得被雨阻挡。”</blockquote><p>王上18:45<blockquote><p>Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain came on and Ahab rode off to Jezreel.<p>霎时间，天因风云黑暗，降下大雨。亚哈就坐车往耶斯列去了。</blockquote><p>王上18:46<blockquote><p>The power of the LORD came upon Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.<p>耶和华的灵（原文作“手”）降在以利亚身上，他就束上腰，奔在亚哈前头，直到耶斯列的城门。</blockquote><h2 id="列王纪上第19章">列王纪上第19章</h2><p>王上19:1<blockquote><p>Now Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.<p>亚哈将以利亚一切所行的和他用刀杀众先知的事，都告诉耶洗别。</blockquote><p>王上19:2<blockquote><p>So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say, “May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them.”<p>耶洗别就差遣人去见以利亚，告诉他说：“明日约在这时候，我若不使你的性命像那些人的性命一样，愿神明重重地降罚与我。”</blockquote><p>王上19:3<blockquote><p>Elijah was afraid and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there,<p>以利亚见这光景，就起来逃命，到了犹大的别是巴，将仆人留在那里。</blockquote><p>王上19:4<blockquote><p>while he himself went a day’s journey into the desert.
