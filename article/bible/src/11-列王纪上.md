## 列王纪上第1章
王上1:1
> When King David was old and well advanced in years, he could not keep warm even when they put covers over him.
>
> 大卫王年纪老迈，虽用被遮盖，仍不觉暖。


王上1:2
> So his servants said to him, "Let us look for a young virgin to attend the king and take care of him. She can lie beside him so that our lord the king may keep warm."
>
> 所以臣仆对他说：“不如为我主我王寻找一个处女，使她伺候王，奉养王，睡在王的怀中，好叫我主我王得暖。”


王上1:3
> Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful girl and found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
>
> 于是，在以色列全境寻找美貌的童女，寻得书念的一个童女亚比煞，就带到王那里。


王上1:4
> The girl was very beautiful; she took care of the king and waited on him, but the king had no intimate relations with her.
>
> 这童女极其美貌，她奉养王，伺候王，王却没有与她亲近。


王上1:5
> Now Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, put himself forward and said, "I will be king." So he got chariots and horses ready, with fifty men to run ahead of him.
>
> 那时，哈及的儿子亚多尼雅自尊，说：“我必作王。”就为自己预备车辆、马兵，又派五十人在他前头奔走。


王上1:6
> (His father had never interfered with him by asking, "Why do you behave as you do?" He was also very handsome and was born next after Absalom.)
>
> 他父亲素来没有使他忧闷，说：“你是做什么呢？”他甚俊美，生在押沙龙之后。


王上1:7
> Adonijah conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they gave him their support.
>
> 亚多尼雅与洗鲁雅的儿子约押和祭司亚比亚他商议，二人就顺从他，帮助他。


王上1:8
> But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei and Rei and David's special guard did not join Adonijah.
>
> 但祭司撒督、耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅、先知拿单、示每、利以并大卫的勇士，都不顺从亚多尼雅。


王上1:9
> Adonijah then sacrificed sheep, cattle and fattened calves at the Stone of Zoheleth near En Rogel. He invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah who were royal officials,
>
> 一日，亚多尼雅在隐罗结旁、琐希列磐石那里，宰了牛羊、肥犊，请他的诸弟兄，就是王的众子，并所有作王臣仆的犹大人；


王上1:10
> but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the special guard or his brother Solomon.
>
> 惟独先知拿单和比拿雅并勇士，与他的兄弟所罗门，他都没有请。


王上1:11
> Then Nathan asked Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, "Have you not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has become king without our lord David's knowing it?
>
> 拿单对所罗门的母亲拔示巴说：“哈及的儿子亚多尼雅作王了，你没有听见吗？我们的主大卫却不知道。


王上1:12
> Now then, let me advise you how you can save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.
>
> 现在我可以给你出个主意，好保全你和你儿子所罗门的性命。


王上1:13
> Go in to King David and say to him, 'My lord the king, did you not swear to me your servant: "Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne"? Why then has Adonijah become king?'
>
> 你进去见大卫王，对他说：‘我主我王啊，你不曾向婢女起誓说：你儿子所罗门必接续我作王，坐在我的位上吗？现在亚多尼雅怎么作了王呢？’


王上1:14
> While you are still there talking to the king, I will come in and confirm what you have said."
>
> 你还与王说话的时候，我也随后进去，证实你的话。”


王上1:15
> So Bathsheba went to see the aged king in his room, where Abishag the Shunammite was attending him.
>
> 拔示巴进入内室见王，王甚老迈，书念的童女亚比煞正伺候王。


王上1:16
> Bathsheba bowed low and knelt before the king. "What is it you want?" the king asked.
>
> 拔示巴向王屈身下拜。王说：“你要什么？”


王上1:17
> She said to him, "My lord, you yourself swore to me your servant by the LORD your God: 'Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne.'
>
> 她说：“我主啊，你曾向婢女指着耶和华你的　神起誓说：‘你儿子所罗门必接续我作王，坐在我的位上。’


王上1:18
> But now Adonijah has become king, and you, my lord the king, do not know about it.
>
> 现在亚多尼雅作王了，我主我王却不知道。


王上1:19
> He has sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep, and has invited all the king's sons, Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army, but he has not invited Solomon your servant.
>
> 他宰了许多牛羊、肥犊，请了王的众子和祭司亚比亚他，并元帅约押；惟独王的仆人所罗门，他没有请。


王上1:20
> My lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to learn from you who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
>
> 我主我王啊，以色列众人的眼目都仰望你，等你晓谕他们，在我主我王之后，谁坐你的位。


王上1:21
> Otherwise, as soon as my lord the king is laid to rest with his fathers, I and my son Solomon will be treated as criminals."
>
> 若不然，到我主我王与列祖同睡以后，我和我儿子所罗门必算为罪人了。”


王上1:22
> While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived.
>
> 拔示巴还与王说话的时候，先知拿单也进来了。


王上1:23
> And they told the king, "Nathan the prophet is here." So he went before the king and bowed with his face to the ground.
>
> 有人奏告王说：“先知拿单来了。”拿单进到王前，脸伏于地。


王上1:24
> Nathan said, "Have you, my lord the king, declared that Adonijah shall be king after you, and that he will sit on your throne?
>
> 拿单说：“我主我王果然应许亚多尼雅说：‘你必接续我作王，坐在我的位上’吗？


王上1:25
> Today he has gone down and sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep. He has invited all the king's sons, the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest. Right now they are eating and drinking with him and saying, 'Long live King Adonijah!'
>
> 他今日下去，宰了许多牛羊、肥犊，请了王的众子和军长，并祭司亚比亚他，他们正在亚多尼雅面前吃喝，说：‘愿亚多尼雅王万岁！’


王上1:26
> But me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon he did not invite.
>
> 惟独我，就是你的仆人和祭司撒督，耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅，并王的仆人所罗门，他都没有请。


王上1:27
> Is this something my lord the king has done without letting his servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"
>
> 这事果然出乎我主我王吗？王却没有告诉仆人们，在我主我王之后，谁坐你的位。”


王上1:28
> Then King David said, "Call in Bathsheba." So she came into the king's presence and stood before him.
>
> 大卫王吩咐说：“叫拔示巴来。”拔示巴就进来站在王面前。


王上1:29
> The king then took an oath: "As surely as the LORD lives, who has delivered me out of every trouble,
>
> 王起誓说：“我指着救我性命脱离一切苦难，永生的耶和华起誓。


王上1:30
> I will surely carry out today what I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel: Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne in my place."
>
> 我既然指着耶和华以色列的　神向你起誓说：‘你儿子所罗门必接续我作王，坐在我的位上。’我今日就必照这话而行。”


王上1:31
> Then Bathsheba bowed low with her face to the ground and, kneeling before the king, said, "May my lord King David live forever!"
>
> 于是拔示巴脸伏于地，向王下拜，说：“愿我主大卫王万岁！”


王上1:32
> King David said, "Call in Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet and Benaiah son of Jehoiada." When they came before the king,
>
> 大卫王又吩咐说：“将祭司撒督、先知拿单、耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅召来。”他们就都来到王面前。


王上1:33
> he said to them: "Take your lord's servants with you and set Solomon my son on my own mule and take him down to Gihon.
>
> 王对他们说：“要带领你们主的仆人，使我儿子所罗门骑我的骡子，送他下到基训。


王上1:34
> There have Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel. Blow the trumpet and shout, 'Long live King Solomon!'
>
> 在那里，祭司撒督和先知拿单要膏他作以色列的王。你们也要吹角，说：‘愿所罗门王万岁！’


王上1:35
> Then you are to go up with him, and he is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place. I have appointed him ruler over Israel and Judah."
>
> 然后要跟随他上来，使他坐在我的位上，接续我作王。我已立他作以色列和犹大的君。”


王上1:36
> Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king, "Amen! May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, so declare it.
>
> 耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅对王说：“阿们！愿耶和华我主我王的　神也这样命定。


王上1:37
> As the LORD was with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon to make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord King David!"
>
> 耶和华怎样与我主我王同在，愿他照样与所罗门同在，使他的国位比我主大卫王的国位更大。”


王上1:38
> So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites went down and put Solomon on King David's mule and escorted him to Gihon.
>
> 于是，祭司撒督、先知拿单、耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅和基利提人、比利提人，都下去使所罗门骑大卫王的骡子，将他送到基训。


王上1:39
> Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the sacred tent and anointed Solomon. Then they sounded the trumpet and all the people shouted, "Long live King Solomon!"
>
> 祭司撒督就从帐幕中取了盛膏油的角来，用膏膏所罗门。人就吹角，众民都说：“愿所罗门王万岁！”


王上1:40
> And all the people went up after him, playing flutes and rejoicing greatly, so that the ground shook with the sound.
>
> 众民跟随他上来，且吹笛，大大欢呼，声音震地。


王上1:41
> Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they were finishing their feast. On hearing the sound of the trumpet, Joab asked, "What's the meaning of all the noise in the city?"
>
> 亚多尼雅和所请的众客筵宴方毕，听见这声音。约押听见角声，就说：“城中为何有这响声呢？”


王上1:42
> Even as he was speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. Adonijah said, "Come in. A worthy man like you must be bringing good news."
>
> 他正说话的时候，祭司亚比亚他的儿子约拿单来了。亚多尼雅对他说：“进来吧！你是个忠义的人，必是报好信息。”


王上1:43
> "Not at all!" Jonathan answered. "Our lord King David has made Solomon king.
>
> 约拿单对亚多尼雅说：“我们的主大卫王诚然立所罗门为王了。


王上1:44
> The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and they have put him on the king's mule,
>
> 王差遣祭司撒督、先知拿单、耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅和基利提人、比利提人都去使所罗门骑王的骡子。


王上1:45
> and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon. From there they have gone up cheering, and the city resounds with it. That's the noise you hear.
>
> 祭司撒督和先知拿单在基训已经膏他作王。众人都从那里欢呼着上来，声音使城震动，这就是你们所听见的声音。


王上1:46
> Moreover, Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne.
>
> 并且所罗门登了国位。


王上1:47
> Also, the royal officials have come to congratulate our lord King David, saying, 'May your God make Solomon's name more famous than yours and his throne greater than yours!' And the king bowed in worship on his bed
>
> 王的臣仆也来为我们的主大卫王祝福说：‘愿王的　神使所罗门的名比王的名更尊荣，使他的国位比王的国位更大。’王就在床上屈身下拜。


王上1:48
> and said, 'Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has allowed my eyes to see a successor on my throne today.'"
>
> 王又说：‘耶和华以色列的　神是应当称颂的！因他赐我一人今日坐在我的位上，我也亲眼看见了。’”


王上1:49
> At this, all Adonijah's guests rose in alarm and dispersed.
>
> 亚多尼雅的众客听见这话就都惊惧，起来四散。


王上1:50
> But Adonijah, in fear of Solomon, went and took hold of the horns of the altar.
>
> 亚多尼雅惧怕所罗门，就起来，去抓住祭坛的角。


王上1:51
> Then Solomon was told, "Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon and is clinging to the horns of the altar. He says, 'Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.'"
>
> 有人告诉所罗门说：“亚多尼雅惧怕所罗门王，现在抓住祭坛的角说：‘愿所罗门王今日向我起誓，必不用刀杀仆人。’”


王上1:52
> Solomon replied, "If he shows himself to be a worthy man, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground; but if evil is found in him, he will die."
>
> 所罗门说：“他若作忠义的人，连一根头皮也不至落在地上；他若行恶，必要死亡。”


王上1:53
> Then King Solomon sent men, and they brought him down from the altar. And Adonijah came and bowed down to King Solomon, and Solomon said, "Go to your home."
>
> 于是，所罗门王差遣人，使亚多尼雅从坛上下来，他就来向所罗门王下拜。所罗门对他说：“你回家去吧！”


## 列王纪上第2章
王上2:1
> When the time drew near for David to die, he gave a charge to Solomon his son.
>
> 大卫的死期临近了，就嘱咐他儿子所罗门说：


王上2:2
> "I am about to go the way of all the earth," he said. "So be strong, show yourself a man,
>
> “我现在要走世人必走的路，所以你当刚强，作大丈夫，


王上2:3
> and observe what the LORD your God requires: Walk in his ways, and keep his decrees and commands, his laws and requirements, as written in the Law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you go,
>
> 遵守耶和华你　神所吩咐的，照着摩西律法上所写的行主的道，谨守他的律例、诫命、典章、法度。这样，你无论做什么事，不拘往何处去，尽都亨通。


王上2:4
> and that the LORD may keep his promise to me: 'If your descendants watch how they live, and if they walk faithfully before me with all their heart and soul, you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.'
>
> 耶和华必成就向我所应许的话说：‘你的子孙若谨慎自己的行为，尽心尽意、诚诚实实地行在我面前，就不断人坐以色列的国位。’


王上2:5
> "Now you yourself know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me--what he did to the two commanders of Israel's armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He killed them, shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle, and with that blood stained the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet.
>
> 你知道洗鲁雅的儿子约押向我所行的，就是杀了以色列的两个元帅：尼珥的儿子押尼珥和益帖的儿子亚玛撒。他在太平之时流这二人的血，如在争战之时一样，将这血染了腰间束的带和脚上穿的鞋。


王上2:6
> Deal with him according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace.
>
> 所以你要照你的智慧行，不容他白头安然下阴间。


王上2:7
> "But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table. They stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom.
>
> 你当恩待基列人巴西莱的众子，使他们常与你同席吃饭，因为我躲避你哥哥押沙龙的时候，他们拿食物来迎接我。


王上2:8
> "And remember, you have with you Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, who called down bitter curses on me the day I went to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD: 'I will not put you to death by the sword.'
>
> 在你这里有巴户琳的便雅悯人基拉的儿子示每，我往玛哈念去的那日，他用狠毒的言语咒骂我，后来却下约旦河迎接我，我就指着耶和华向他起誓说：‘我必不用刀杀你。’


王上2:9
> But now, do not consider him innocent. You are a man of wisdom; you will know what to do to him. Bring his gray head down to the grave in blood."
>
> 现在你不要以他为无罪，你是聪明人，必知道怎样待他，使他白头见杀，流血下到阴间。”


王上2:10
> Then David rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David.
>
> 大卫与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫城。


王上2:11
> He had reigned forty years over Israel--seven years in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem.
>
> 大卫作以色列王四十年：在希伯仑作王七年；在耶路撒冷作王三十三年。


王上2:12
> So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his rule was firmly established.
>
> 所罗门坐他父亲大卫的位，他的国甚是坚固。


王上2:13
> Now Adonijah, the son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. Bathsheba asked him, "Do you come peacefully?" He answered, "Yes, peacefully."
>
> 哈及的儿子亚多尼雅去见所罗门的母亲拔示巴，拔示巴问他说：“你来是为平安吗？”回答说：“是为平安。”


王上2:14
> Then he added, "I have something to say to you." "You may say it," she replied.
>
> 又说：“我有话对你说。”拔示巴说：“你说吧。”


王上2:15
> "As you know," he said, "the kingdom was mine. All Israel looked to me as their king. But things changed, and the kingdom has gone to my brother; for it has come to him from the LORD.
>
> 亚多尼雅说：“你知道国原是归我的，以色列众人也都仰望我作王。不料，国反归了我兄弟，因他得国是出乎耶和华。


王上2:16
> Now I have one request to make of you. Do not refuse me." "You may make it," she said.
>
> 现在，我有一件事求你，望你不要推辞。”拔示巴说：“你说吧！”


王上2:17
> So he continued, "Please ask King Solomon--he will not refuse you--to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife."
>
> 他说：“求你请所罗门王将书念的女子亚比煞赐我为妻，因他必不推辞你。”


王上2:18
> "Very well," Bathsheba replied, "I will speak to the king for you."
>
> 拔示巴说：“好，我必为你对王提说。”


王上2:19
> When Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah, the king stood up to meet her, bowed down to her and sat down on his throne. He had a throne brought for the king's mother, and she sat down at his right hand.
>
> 于是，拔示巴去见所罗门王，要为亚多尼雅提说。王起来迎接，向她下拜，就坐在位上，吩咐人为王母设一座位，她便坐在王的右边。


王上2:20
> "I have one small request to make of you," she said. "Do not refuse me." The king replied, "Make it, my mother; I will not refuse you."
>
> 拔示巴说：“我有一件小事求你，望你不要推辞。”王说：“请母亲说，我必不推辞。”


王上2:21
> So she said, "Let Abishag the Shunammite be given in marriage to your brother Adonijah."
>
> 拔示巴说：“求你将书念的女子亚比煞赐给你哥哥亚多尼雅为妻。”


王上2:22
> King Solomon answered his mother, "Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? You might as well request the kingdom for him--after all, he is my older brother--yes, for him and for Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah!"
>
> 所罗门王对他母亲说：“为何单替他求书念的女子亚比煞呢？也可以为他求国吧！他是我的哥哥，他有祭司亚比亚他和洗鲁雅的儿子约押为辅佐。”


王上2:23
> Then King Solomon swore by the LORD: "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if Adonijah does not pay with his life for this request!
>
> 所罗门王就指着耶和华起誓说：“亚多尼雅这话是自己送命，不然，愿　神重重地降罚与我。


王上2:24
> And now, as surely as the LORD lives--he who has established me securely on the throne of my father David and has founded a dynasty for me as he promised--Adonijah shall be put to death today!"
>
> 耶和华坚立我，使我坐在父亲大卫的位上，照着所应许的话为我建立家室。现在我指着永生的耶和华起誓，亚多尼雅今日必被治死。”


王上2:25
> So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck down Adonijah and he died.
>
> 于是，所罗门王差遣耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅将亚多尼雅杀死。


王上2:26
> To Abiathar the priest the king said, "Go back to your fields in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not put you to death now, because you carried the ark of the Sovereign LORD before my father David and shared all my father's hardships."
>
> 王对祭司亚比亚他说：“你回亚拿突归自己的田地去吧！你本是该死的，但因你在我父亲大卫面前抬过主耶和华的约柜，又与我父亲同受一切苦难，所以我今日不将你杀死。”


王上2:27
> So Solomon removed Abiathar from the priesthood of the LORD, fulfilling the word the LORD had spoken at Shiloh about the house of Eli.
>
> 所罗门就革除亚比亚他，不许他作耶和华的祭司。这样，便应验耶和华在示罗论以利家所说的话。


王上2:28
> When the news reached Joab, who had conspired with Adonijah though not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the LORD and took hold of the horns of the altar.
>
> 约押虽然没有归从押沙龙，却归从了亚多尼雅。他听见这风声，就逃到耶和华的帐幕，抓住祭坛的角。


王上2:29
> King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the tent of the LORD and was beside the altar. Then Solomon ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada, "Go, strike him down!"
>
> 有人告诉所罗门王说：“约押逃到耶和华的帐幕，现今在祭坛的旁边。”所罗门就差遣耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅说：“你去将他杀死。”


王上2:30
> So Benaiah entered the tent of the LORD and said to Joab, "The king says, 'Come out!'" But he answered, "No, I will die here." Benaiah reported to the king, "This is how Joab answered me."
>
> 比拿雅来到耶和华的帐幕，对约押说：“王吩咐说：‘你出来吧！’”他说：“我不出去，我要死在这里。”比拿雅就去回覆王，说约押如此如此回答我。


王上2:31
> Then the king commanded Benaiah, "Do as he says. Strike him down and bury him, and so clear me and my father's house of the guilt of the innocent blood that Joab shed.
>
> 王说：“你可以照着他的话行，杀死他，将他葬埋，好叫约押流无辜人血的罪不归我和我的父家了。


王上2:32
> The LORD will repay him for the blood he shed, because without the knowledge of my father David he attacked two men and killed them with the sword. Both of them--Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel's army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah's army--were better men and more upright than he.
>
> 耶和华必使约押流人血的罪归到他自己的头上，因为他用刀杀了两个比他又义又好的人，就是以色列元帅尼珥的儿子押尼珥和犹大元帅益帖的儿子亚玛撒，我父亲大卫却不知道。


王上2:33
> May the guilt of their blood rest on the head of Joab and his descendants forever. But on David and his descendants, his house and his throne, may there be the LORD'S peace forever."
>
> 故此，流这二人血的罪必归到约押和他后裔的头上，直到永远；惟有大卫和他的后裔，并他的家与国，必从耶和华那里得平安，直到永远。”


王上2:34
> So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck down Joab and killed him, and he was buried on his own land in the desert.
>
> 于是，耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅上去，将约押杀死，葬在旷野约押自己的坟墓里（“坟墓”原文作“房屋”）。


王上2:35
> The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab's position and replaced Abiathar with Zadok the priest.
>
> 王就立耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅作元帅，代替约押，又使祭司撒督代替亚比亚他。


王上2:36
> Then the king sent for Shimei and said to him, "Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but do not go anywhere else.
>
> 王差遣人将示每召来，对他说：“你要在耶路撒冷建造房屋居住，不可出来往别处去。


王上2:37
> The day you leave and cross the Kidron Valley, you can be sure you will die; your blood will be on your own head."
>
> 你当确实地知道，你何日出来过汲沦溪，何日必死！你的罪（原文作“血”）必归到自己的头上。”


王上2:38
> Shimei answered the king, "What you say is good. Your servant will do as my lord the king has said." And Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a long time.
>
> 示每对王说：“这话甚好！我主我王怎样说，仆人必怎样行。”于是示每多日住在耶路撒冷。


王上2:39
> But three years later, two of Shimei's slaves ran off to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath, and Shimei was told, "Your slaves are in Gath."
>
> 过了三年，示每的两个仆人逃到迦特王玛迦的儿子亚吉那里去。有人告诉示每说：“你的仆人在迦特。”


王上2:40
> At this, he saddled his donkey and went to Achish at Gath in search of his slaves. So Shimei went away and brought the slaves back from Gath.
>
> 示每起来，备上驴，往迦特到亚吉那里去找他的仆人，就从迦特带他仆人回来。


王上2:41
> When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned,
>
> 有人告诉所罗门说：“示每出耶路撒冷往迦特去，回来了。”


王上2:42

> 大卫击杀琐巴人的时候，利逊招聚了一群人，自己作他们的头目，往大马色居住，在那里作王。


王上11:25
> Rezon was Israel's adversary as long as Solomon lived, adding to the trouble caused by Hadad. So Rezon ruled in Aram and was hostile toward Israel.
>
> 所罗门活着的时候，哈达为患之外，利逊也作以色列的敌人。他恨恶以色列人，且作了亚兰人的王。


王上11:26
> Also, Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against the king. He was one of Solomon's officials, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, and his mother was a widow named Zeruah.
>
> 所罗门的臣仆、尼八的儿子耶罗波安也举手攻击王。他是以法莲支派的洗利达人，他母亲是寡妇，名叫洗鲁阿。


王上11:27
> Here is the account of how he rebelled against the king: Solomon had built the supporting terraces and had filled in the gap in the wall of the city of David his father.
>
> 他举手攻击王的缘故，乃由先前所罗门建造米罗，修补他父亲大卫城的破口。


王上11:28
> Now Jeroboam was a man of standing, and when Solomon saw how well the young man did his work, he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the house of Joseph.
>
> 耶罗波安是大有才能的人。所罗门见这少年人殷勤，就派他监管约瑟家的一切工程。


王上11:29
> About that time Jeroboam was going out of Jerusalem, and Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh met him on the way, wearing a new cloak. The two of them were alone out in the country,

> 一日，耶罗波安出了耶路撒冷，示罗人先知亚希雅在路上遇见他。亚希雅身上穿着一件新衣，他们二人在田野，以外并无别人。


王上11:30
> and Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces.
>
> 亚希雅将自己穿的那件新衣撕成十二片，


王上11:31
> Then he said to Jeroboam, "Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'See, I am going to tear the kingdom out of Solomon's hand and give you ten tribes.
>
> 对耶罗波安说：“你可以拿十片。耶和华以色列的　神如此说：‘我必将国从所罗门手里夺回，将十个支派赐给你。


王上11:32
> But for the sake of my servant David and the city of Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, he will have one tribe.
>
> （我因仆人大卫和我在以色列众支派中所选择的耶路撒冷城的缘故，仍给所罗门留一个支派。）


王上11:33
> I will do this because they have forsaken me and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Molech the god of the Ammonites, and have not walked in my ways, nor done what is right in my eyes, nor kept my statutes and laws as David, Solomon's father, did.
>
> 因为他离弃我，敬拜西顿人的女　神亚斯她录、摩押的神基抹和亚扪人的神米勒公，没有遵从我的道，行我眼中看为正的事，守我的律例典章，像他父亲大卫一样。


王上11:34
> " 'But I will not take the whole kingdom out of Solomon's hand; I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David my servant, whom I chose and who observed my commands and statutes.
>
> 但我不从他手里将全国夺回；使他终身为君，是因我所拣选的仆人大卫谨守我的诫命律例。


王上11:35
> I will take the kingdom from his son's hands and give you ten tribes.
>
> 我必从他儿子的手里将国夺回，以十个支派赐给你，


王上11:36
> I will give one tribe to his son so that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I chose to put my Name.
>
> 还留一个支派给他的儿子，使我仆人大卫在我所选择立我名的耶路撒冷城里，在我面前长有灯光。


王上11:37
> However, as for you, I will take you, and you will rule over all that your heart desires; you will be king over Israel.
>
> 我必拣选你，使你照心里一切所愿的，作王治理以色列。


王上11:38
> If you do whatever I command you and walk in my ways and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and commands, as David my servant did, I will be with you. I will build you a dynasty as enduring as the one I built for David and will give Israel to you.
>
> 你若听从我一切所吩咐你的，遵行我的道，行我眼中看为正的事，谨守我的律例诫命，像我仆人大卫所行的，我就与你同在，为你立坚固的家，像我为大卫所立的一样，将以色列人赐给你。


王上11:39

> As for the other events of Solomon's reign--all he did and the wisdom he displayed--are they not written in the book of the annals of Solomon?

> 所罗门其余的事，凡他所行的和他的智慧，都写在所罗门记上。


王上11:42
> Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
>
> 所罗门在耶路撒冷作以色列众人的王共四十年。


王上11:43
> Then he rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son succeeded him as king.
>
> 所罗门与他列祖同睡，葬在他父亲大卫的城里。他儿子罗波安接续他作王。


## 列王纪上第12章
王上12:1
> Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all the Israelites had gone there to make him king.
>
> 罗波安往示剑去，因为以色列人都到了示剑，要立他作王。


王上12:2
> When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this (he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), he returned from Egypt.
>
> 尼八的儿子耶罗波安先前躲避所罗门王，逃往埃及，住在那里（他听见这事）。


王上12:3
> So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and the whole assembly of Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him:
>
> 以色列人打发人去请他来，他就和以色列会众都来见罗波安，对他说：


王上12:4
> "Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you."
>
> “你父亲使我们负重轭，做苦工，现在求你使我们做的苦工、负的重轭轻松些，我们就事奉你。”


王上12:5
> Rehoboam answered, "Go away for three days and then come back to me." So the people went away.
>
> 罗波安对他们说：“你们暂且去，第三日再来见我。”民就去了。


王上12:6
> Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. "How would you advise me to answer these people?" he asked.
>
> 罗波安之父所罗门在世的日子，有侍立在他面前的老年人，罗波安王和他们商议说：“你们给我出个什么主意，我好回覆这民。”


王上12:7
> They replied, "If today you will be a servant to these people and serve them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants."
>
> 老年人对他说：“现在王若服事这民如仆人，用好话回答他们，他们就永远作王的仆人。”


王上12:8
> But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him.
>
> 王却不用老年人给他出的主意，就和那些与他一同长大在他面前侍立的少年人商议，


王上12:9
> He asked them, "What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, 'Lighten the yoke your father put on us'?"
>
> 说：“这民对我说：‘你父亲使我们负重轭，求你使我们轻松些。’你们给我出个什么主意，我好回覆他们。”


王上12:10
> The young men who had grown up with him replied, "Tell these people who have said to you, 'Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter'--tell them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.
>
> 那同他长大的少年人说：“这民对王说：‘你父亲使我们负重轭，求你使我们轻松些。’王要对他们如此说：‘我的小拇指头比我父亲的腰还粗。


王上12:11
> My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.'"

>
> 耶罗波安和众百姓遵着罗波安王所说“你们第三日再来见我”的那话，第三日他们果然来了。


王上12:13
> The king answered the people harshly. Rejecting the advice given him by the elders,
>
> 王用严厉的话回答百姓，不用老年人给他所出的主意，


王上12:14
> he followed the advice of the young men and said, "My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions."
>
> 照着少年人所出的主意对民说：“我父亲使你们负重轭，我必使你们负更重的轭；我父亲用鞭子责打你们，我要用蝎子鞭责打你们。”


王上12:15
> So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from the LORD, to fulfill the word the LORD had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite.
>
> 王不肯依从百姓，这事乃出于耶和华，为要应验他藉示罗人亚希雅对尼八的儿子耶罗波安所说的话。


王上12:16
> When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king: "What share do we have in David, what part in Jesse's son? To your tents, O Israel! Look after your own house, O David!" So the Israelites went home.
>
> 以色列众民见王不依从他们，就对王说：“我们与大卫有什么分儿呢？与耶西的儿子并没有关涉。以色列人哪，各回各家去吧！大卫家啊，自己顾自己吧！”于是，以色列人都回自己家里去了。


王上12:17
> But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam still ruled over them.
>
> 惟独住犹大城邑的以色列人，罗波安仍作他们的王。


王上12:18
> King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram, who was in charge of forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam, however, managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.
>
> 罗波安王差遣掌管服苦之人的亚多兰往以色列人那里去，以色列人就用石头打死他。罗波安王急忙上车，逃回耶路撒冷去了。


王上12:19
> So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
>
> 这样，以色列人背叛大卫家，直到今日。


王上12:20
> When all the Israelites heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David.
>
> 以色列众人听见耶罗波安回来了，就打发人去请他到会众面前，立他作以色列众人的王。除了犹大支派以外，没有顺从大卫家的。


王上12:21
> When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mustered the whole house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin--a hundred and eighty thousand fighting men--to make war against the house of Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam son of Solomon.
>
> 罗波安来到耶路撒冷，招聚犹大全家和便雅悯支派的人共十八万，都是挑选的战士，要与以色列家争战，好将国夺回，再归所罗门的儿子罗波安。


王上12:22
> But this word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God:
>
> 但　神的话临到神人示玛雅说：


王上12:23
> "Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, to the whole house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people,
>
> “你去告诉所罗门的儿子犹大王罗波安和犹大、便雅悯全家并其余的民说：


王上12:24
> 'This is what the LORD says: Do not go up to fight against your brothers, the Israelites. Go home, every one of you, for this is my doing.'" So they obeyed the word of the LORD and went home again, as the LORD had ordered.
>
> ‘耶和华如此说：你们不可上去与你们的弟兄以色列人争战，各归各家去吧！因为这事出于我。’”众人就听从耶和华的话，遵着耶和华的命回去了。


王上12:25
> Then Jeroboam fortified Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. From there he went out and built up Peniel.
>
> 耶罗波安在以法莲山地建筑示剑，就住在其中。又从示剑出去，建筑毗努伊勒。


王上12:26
> Jeroboam thought to himself, "The kingdom will now likely revert to the house of David.
>
> 耶罗波安心里说：“恐怕这国仍归大卫家。


王上12:27
> If these people go up to offer sacrifices at the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem, they will again give their allegiance to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah. They will kill me and return to King Rehoboam."
>
> 这民若上耶路撒冷去，在耶和华的殿里献祭，他们的心必归向他们的主犹大王罗波安，就把我杀了，仍归犹大王罗波安。”


王上12:28
> After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves. He said to the people, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt."
>
> 耶罗波安王就筹划定妥，铸造了两个金牛犊，对众民说：“以色列人哪，你们上耶路撒冷去实在是难，这就是领你们出埃及地的　神。”


王上12:29
> One he set up in Bethel, and the other in Dan.
>
> 他就把牛犊一只安在伯特利，一只安在但。


王上12:30
> And this thing became a sin; the people went even as far as Dan to worship the one there.
>
> 这事叫百姓陷在罪里，因为他们往但去拜那牛犊。


王上12:31
> Jeroboam built shrines on high places and appointed priests from all sorts of people, even though they were not Levites.
>
> 耶罗波安在邱坛那里建殿，将那不属利未人的凡民立为祭司。


王上12:32
> He instituted a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the festival held in Judah, and offered sacrifices on the altar. This he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves he had made. And at Bethel he also installed priests at the high places he had made.
>
> 耶罗波安定八月十五日为节期，像在犹大的节期一样，自己上坛献祭。他在伯特利也这样向他所铸的牛犊献祭，又将立为邱坛的祭司安置在伯特利。


王上12:33
> On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a month of his own choosing, he offered sacrifices on the altar he had built at Bethel. So he instituted the festival for the Israelites and went up to the altar to make offerings.
>
> 他在八月十五日，就是他私自所定的月日，为以色列人立作节期的日子，在伯特利上坛烧香。


## 列王纪上第13章
王上13:1
> By the word of the LORD a man of God came from Judah to Bethel, as Jeroboam was standing by the altar to make an offering.
>
> 那时，有一个神人奉耶和华的命从犹大来到伯特利，耶罗波安正站在坛旁要烧香。


王上13:2
> He cried out against the altar by the word of the LORD: "O altar, altar! This is what the LORD says: 'A son named Josiah will be born to the house of David. On you he will sacrifice the priests of the high places who now make offerings here, and human bones will be burned on you.'"
>
> 神人奉耶和华的命向坛呼叫说：“坛哪，坛哪！耶和华如此说：‘大卫家里必生一个儿子，名叫约西亚。他必将邱坛的祭司，就是在你上面烧香的，杀在你上面，人的骨头也必烧在你上面。’”


王上13:3
> That same day the man of God gave a sign: "This is the sign the LORD has declared: The altar will be split apart and the ashes on it will be poured out."
>
> 当日，神人设个预兆说：“这坛必破裂，坛上的灰必倾撒。这是耶和华说的预兆。”


王上13:4
> When King Jeroboam heard what the man of God cried out against the altar at Bethel, he stretched out his hand from the altar and said, "Seize him!" But the hand he stretched out toward the man shriveled up, so that he could not pull it back.
>
> 耶罗波安王听见神人向伯特利的坛呼叫的话，就从坛上伸手说：“拿住他吧！”王向神人所伸的手就枯干了，不能弯回；


王上13:5
> Also, the altar was split apart and its ashes poured out according to the sign given by the man of God by the word of the LORD.
>
> 坛也破裂了，坛上的灰倾撒了，正如神人奉耶和华的命所设的预兆。


王上13:6
> Then the king said to the man of God, "Intercede with the LORD your God and pray for me that my hand may be restored." So the man of God interceded with the LORD, and the king's hand was restored and became as it was before.
>
> 王对神人说：“请你为我祷告，求耶和华你　神的恩典，使我的手复原。”于是神人祈祷耶和华，王的手就复了原，仍如寻常一样。


王上13:7
> The king said to the man of God, "Come home with me and have something to eat, and I will give you a gift."
>
> 王对神人说：“请你同我回去吃饭，加添心力，我也必给你赏赐。”


王上13:8
> But the man of God answered the king, "Even if you were to give me half your possessions, I would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water here.
>
> 神人对王说：“你就是把你的宫一半给我，我也不同你进去，也不在这地方吃饭喝水，


王上13:9
> For I was commanded by the word of the LORD: 'You must not eat bread or drink water or return by the way you came.'"
>
> 因为有耶和华的话嘱咐我说：‘不可在伯特利吃饭喝水，也不可从你去的原路回来。’”


王上13:10
> So he took another road and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel.
>
> 于是，神人从别的路回去，不从伯特利来的原路回去。


王上13:11
> Now there was a certain old prophet living in Bethel, whose sons came and told him all that the man of God had done there that day. They also told their father what he had said to the king.
>
> 有一个老先知住在伯特利，他儿子们来将神人当日在伯特利所行的一切事和向王所说的话，都告诉了父亲。


王上13:12
> Their father asked them, "Which way did he go?" And his sons showed him which road the man of God from Judah had taken.
>
> 父亲问他们说：“神人从哪条路去了呢？”儿子们就告诉他。原来他们看见那从犹大来的神人所去的路。


王上13:13
> So he said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." And when they had saddled the donkey for him, he mounted it
>
> 老先知就吩咐他儿子们说：“你们为我备驴。”他们备好了驴，他就骑上，


王上13:14
> and rode after the man of God. He found him sitting under an oak tree and asked, "Are you the man of God who came from Judah?" "I am," he replied.
>
> 去追赶神人，遇见他坐在橡树底下，就问他说：“你是从犹大来的神人不是？”他说：“是。”


王上13:15
> So the prophet said to him, "Come home with me and eat."
>
> 老先知对他说：“请你同我回家吃饭。”


王上13:16
> The man of God said, "I cannot turn back and go with you, nor can I eat bread or drink water with you in this place.
>
> 神人说：“我不可同你回去进你的家，也不可在这里同你吃饭喝水，


王上13:17
> I have been told by the word of the LORD: 'You must not eat bread or drink water there or return by the way you came.'"
>
> 因为有耶和华的话嘱咐我说：‘你在那里不可吃饭喝水，也不可从你去的原路回来。’”


王上13:18
> The old prophet answered, "I too am a prophet, as you are. And an angel said to me by the word of the LORD: 'Bring him back with you to your house so that he may eat bread and drink water.'" (But he was lying to him.)
>
> 老先知对他说：“我也是先知，和你一样。有天使奉耶和华的命对我说：‘你去把他带回你的家，叫他吃饭喝水。’”这都是老先知诓哄他。


王上13:19
> So the man of God returned with him and ate and drank in his house.
>
> 于是，神人同老先知回去，在他家里吃饭喝水。


王上13:20
> While they were sitting at the table, the word of the LORD came to the old prophet who had brought him back.
>
> 二人坐席的时候，耶和华的话临到那带神人回来的先知。


王上13:21
> He cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, "This is what the LORD says: 'You have defied the word of the LORD and have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you.
>
> 他就对那从犹大来的神人说：“耶和华如此说：‘你既违背耶和华的话，不遵守耶和华你　神的命令，


王上13:22
> You came back and ate bread and drank water in the place where he told you not to eat or drink. Therefore your body will not be buried in the tomb of your fathers.'"
>
> 反倒回来，在耶和华禁止你吃饭喝水的地方吃了喝了，因此你的尸身不得入你列祖的坟墓。’”


王上13:23
> When the man of God had finished eating and drinking, the prophet who had brought him back saddled his donkey for him.
>
> 吃喝完了，老先知为所带回来的先知备驴。


王上13:24
> As he went on his way, a lion met him on the road and killed him, and his body was thrown down on the road, with both the donkey and the lion standing beside it.
>
> 他就去了。在路上有个狮子遇见他，将他咬死，尸身倒在路上，驴站在尸身旁边，狮子也站在尸身旁边。


王上13:25
> Some people who passed by saw the body thrown down there, with the lion standing beside the body, and they went and reported it in the city where the old prophet lived.
>
> 有人从那里经过，看见尸身倒在路上，狮子站在尸身旁边，就来到老先知所住的城里述说这事。


王上13:26
> When the prophet who had brought him back from his journey heard of it, he said, "It is the man of God who defied the word of the LORD. The LORD has given him over to the lion, which has mauled him and killed him, as the word of the LORD had warned him."
>
> 那带神人回来的先知听见这事，就说：“这是那违背了耶和华命令的神人，所以耶和华把他交给狮子；狮子抓伤他，咬死他，是应验耶和华对他说的话。”


王上13:27
> The prophet said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me," and they did so.
>
> 老先知就吩咐他儿子们说：“你们为我备驴。”他们就备了驴。


王上13:28
> Then he went out and found the body thrown down on the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion had neither eaten the body nor mauled the donkey.
>
> 他去了，看见神人的尸身倒在路上，驴和狮子站在尸身旁边，狮子却没有吃尸身，也没有抓伤驴。


王上13:29
> So the prophet picked up the body of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back to his own city to mourn for him and bury him.
>
> 老先知就把神人的尸身驮在驴上，带回自己的城里，要哀哭他，葬埋他；


王上13:30
> Then he laid the body in his own tomb, and they mourned over him and said, "Oh, my brother!"
>
> 就把他的尸身葬在自己的坟墓里，哀哭他说：“哀哉！我兄啊。”


王上13:31
> After burying him, he said to his sons, "When I die, bury me in the grave where the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
>
> 安葬之后，老先知对他儿子们说：“我死了，你们要葬我在神人的坟墓里，使我的尸骨靠近他的尸骨。


王上13:32
> For the message he declared by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the shrines on the high places in the towns of Samaria will certainly come true."
>
> 因为他奉耶和华的命指着伯特利的坛，和撒马利亚各城有邱坛之殿所说的话，必定应验。”


王上13:33
> Even after this, Jeroboam did not change his evil ways, but once more appointed priests for the high places from all sorts of people. Anyone who wanted to become a priest he consecrated for the high places.
>
> 这事以后，耶罗波安仍不离开他的恶道，将凡民立为邱坛的祭司；凡愿意的，他都分别为圣，立为邱坛的祭司。


王上13:34
> This was the sin of the house of Jeroboam that led to its downfall and to its destruction from the face of the earth.
>
> 这事叫耶罗波安的家陷在罪里，甚至他的家从地上除灭了。


## 列王纪上第14章
王上14:1
> At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill,
>
> 那时，耶罗波安的儿子亚比雅病了。


王上14:2
> and Jeroboam said to his wife, "Go, disguise yourself, so you won't be recognized as the wife of Jeroboam. Then go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is there--the one who told me I would be king over this people.
>
> 耶罗波安对他的妻说：“你可以起来改装，使人不知道你是耶罗波安的妻，往示罗去，在那里有先知亚希雅。他曾告诉我说：‘你必作这民的王。’


王上14:3
> Take ten loaves of bread with you, some cakes and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy."
>
> 现在你要带十个饼与几个薄饼和一瓶蜜去见他，他必告诉你儿子将要怎样。”


王上14:4
> So Jeroboam's wife did what he said and went to Ahijah's house in Shiloh. Now Ahijah could not see; his sight was gone because of his age.
>
> 耶罗波安的妻就这样行，起身往示罗去，到了亚希雅的家。亚希雅因年纪老迈，眼目发直，不能看见。


王上14:5
> But the LORD had told Ahijah, "Jeroboam's wife is coming to ask you about her son, for he is ill, and you are to give her such and such an answer. When she arrives, she will pretend to be someone else."
>
> 耶和华先晓谕亚希雅说：“耶罗波安的妻要来问你，因她儿子病了，你当如此如此告诉她。她进来的时候，必装作别的妇人。”


王上14:6
> So when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps at the door, he said, "Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why this pretense? I have been sent to you with bad news.
>
> 她刚进门，亚希雅听见她脚步的响声，就说：“耶罗波安的妻，进来吧！你为何装作别的妇人呢？我奉差遣将凶事告诉你。


王上14:7
> Go, tell Jeroboam that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'I raised you up from among the people and made you a leader over my people Israel.

> 你回去告诉耶罗波安说：‘耶和华以色列的　神如此说：我从民中将你高举，立你作我民以色列的君，


王上14:8
> I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you, but you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commands and followed me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes.

> 以利亚就起身往撒勒法去。到了城门，见有一个寡妇在那里捡柴。以利亚呼叫她说：“求你用器皿取点水来给我喝。”


王上17:11
> As she was going to get it, he called, "And bring me, please, a piece of bread."
>
> 她去取水的时候，以利亚又呼叫她说：“也求你拿点饼来给我！”


王上17:12
> "As surely as the LORD your God lives," she replied, "I don't have any bread--only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. I am gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son, that we may eat it--and die."
>
> 她说：“我指着永生耶和华你的　神起誓，我没有饼，坛内只有一把面，瓶里只有一点油。我现在找两根柴，回家要为我和我儿子做饼。我们吃了，死就死吧!”


王上17:13
> Elijah said to her, "Don't be afraid. Go home and do as you have said. But first make a small cake of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me, and then make something for yourself and your son.
>
> 以利亚对她说：“不要惧怕，可以照你所说的去做吧！只要先为我做一个小饼，拿来给我，然后为你和你的儿子做饼。


王上17:14
> For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the LORD gives rain on the land.'"
>
> 因为耶和华以色列的　神如此说：‘坛内的面必不减少，瓶里的油必不缺短，直到耶和华使雨降在地上的日子。’”


王上17:15
> She went away and did as Elijah had told her. So there was food every day for Elijah and for the woman and her family.
>
> 妇人就照以利亚的话去行。她和她家中的人并以利亚，吃了许多日子。


王上17:16
> For the jar of flour was not used up and the jug of oil did not run dry, in keeping with the word of the LORD spoken by Elijah.
>
> 坛内的面果不减少，瓶里的油也不缺短，正如耶和华藉以利亚所说的话。


王上17:17
> Some time later the son of the woman who owned the house became ill. He grew worse and worse, and finally stopped breathing.
>
> 这事以后，作那家主母的妇人，她儿子病了，病得甚重，以致身无气息。


王上17:18
> She said to Elijah, "What do you have against me, man of God? Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?"
>
> 妇人对以利亚说：“神人哪，我与你何干？你竟到我这里来，使　神想念我的罪，以致我的儿子死呢？”


王上17:19
> "Give me your son," Elijah replied. He took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his bed.
>
> 以利亚对她说：“把你儿子交给我。”以利亚就从妇人怀中将孩子接过来，抱到他所住的楼中，放在自己的床上。


王上17:20
> Then he cried out to the LORD, "O LORD my God, have you brought tragedy also upon this widow I am staying with, by causing her son to die?"
>
> 就求告耶和华说：“耶和华我的　神啊！我寄居在这寡妇的家里，你就降祸与她，使她的儿子死了吗？”


王上17:21
> Then he stretched himself out on the boy three times and cried to the LORD, "O LORD my God, let this boy's life return to him!"
>
> 以利亚三次伏在孩子的身上求告耶和华说：“耶和华我的　神啊，求你使这孩子的灵魂仍入他的身体！”


王上17:22
> The LORD heard Elijah's cry, and the boy's life returned to him, and he lived.
>
> 耶和华应允以利亚的话，孩子的灵魂仍入他的身体，他就活了。


王上17:23
> Elijah picked up the child and carried him down from the room into the house. He gave him to his mother and said, "Look, your son is alive!"
>
> 以利亚将孩子从楼上抱下来，进屋子交给他母亲说：“看哪！你的儿子活了！”


王上17:24
> Then the woman said to Elijah, "Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the LORD from your mouth is the truth."
>
> 妇人对以利亚说：“现在我知道你是神人，耶和华借你口所说的话是真的。”


## 列王纪上第18章
王上18:1
> After a long time, in the third year, the word of the LORD came to Elijah: "Go and present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the land."
>
> 过了许久，到第三年，耶和华的话临到以利亚说：“你去，使亚哈得见你，我要降雨在地上。”


王上18:2
> So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria,
>
> 以利亚就去，要使亚哈得见他。那时，撒马利亚有大饥荒。


王上18:3
> and Ahab had summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of his palace. (Obadiah was a devout believer in the LORD.
>
> 亚哈将他的家宰俄巴底召了来。俄巴底甚是敬畏耶和华。


王上18:4
> While Jezebel was killing off the LORD'S prophets, Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them in two caves, fifty in each, and had supplied them with food and water.)
>
> 耶洗别杀耶和华众先知的时候，俄巴底将一百个先知藏了，每五十人藏在一个洞里，拿饼和水供养他们。


王上18:5
> Ahab had said to Obadiah, "Go through the land to all the springs and valleys. Maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive so we will not have to kill any of our animals."
>
> 亚哈对俄巴底说：“我们走遍这地，到一切水泉旁和一切溪边，或者找得着青草，可以救活骡马，免得绝了牲畜。”


王上18:6
> So they divided the land they were to cover, Ahab going in one direction and Obadiah in another.
>
> 于是二人分地游行，亚哈独走一路，俄巴底独走一路。


王上18:7
> As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down to the ground, and said, "Is it really you, my lord Elijah?"
>
> 俄巴底在路上恰与以利亚相遇，俄巴底认出他来，就俯伏在地说：“你是我主以利亚不是？”


王上18:8
> "Yes," he replied. "Go tell your master, 'Elijah is here.'"
>
> 回答说：“是，你去告诉你主人说：‘以利亚在这里。’”


王上18:9
> "What have I done wrong," asked Obadiah, "that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be put to death?
>
> 俄巴底说：“仆人有什么罪，你竟要将我交在亚哈手里，使他杀我呢？


王上18:10
> As surely as the LORD your God lives, there is not a nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to look for you. And whenever a nation or kingdom claimed you were not there, he made them swear they could not find you.
>
> 我指着永生耶和华你的　神起誓，无论哪一邦、哪一国，我主都打发人去找你。若说你没有在那里，就必使那邦那国的人起誓，说实在是找不着你。


王上18:11
> But now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.'
>
> 现在你说：‘要去告诉你主人说：以利亚在这里。’


王上18:12
> I don't know where the Spirit of the LORD may carry you when I leave you. If I go and tell Ahab and he doesn't find you, he will kill me. Yet I your servant have worshiped the LORD since my youth.
>
> 恐怕我一离开你，耶和华的灵就提你到我所不知道的地方去。这样，我去告诉亚哈，他若找不着你，就必杀我；仆人却是自幼敬畏耶和华的。


王上18:13
> Haven't you heard, my lord, what I did while Jezebel was killing the prophets of the LORD? I hid a hundred of the LORD'S prophets in two caves, fifty in each, and supplied them with food and water.
>
> 耶洗别杀耶和华众先知的时候，我将耶和华的一百个先知藏了，每五十人藏在一个洞里，拿饼和水供养他们，岂没有人将这事告诉我主吗?


王上18:14
> And now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.' He will kill me!"
>
> 现在你说：‘要去告诉你主人说：以利亚在这里’；他必杀我。”


王上18:15
> Elijah said, "As the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, I will surely present myself to Ahab today."
>
> 以利亚说：“我指着所事奉永生的万军之耶和华起誓，我今日必使亚哈得见我。”


王上18:16
> So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
>
> 于是，俄巴底去迎着亚哈，告诉他，亚哈就去迎着以利亚。


王上18:17
> When he saw Elijah, he said to him, "Is that you, you troubler of Israel?"
>
> 亚哈见了以利亚，便说：“使以色列遭灾的就是你吗?”


王上18:18
> "I have not made trouble for Israel," Elijah replied. "But you and your father's family have. You have abandoned the LORD'S commands and have followed the Baals.
>
> 以利亚说：“使以色列遭灾的不是我，乃是你和你父家，因为你们离弃耶和华的诫命，去随从巴力。


王上18:19
> Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. And bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table."
>
> 现在你当差遣人，招聚以色列众人和事奉巴力的那四百五十个先知，并耶洗别所供养事奉亚舍拉的那四百个先知，使他们都上迦密山去见我。”


王上18:20
> So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel.
>
> 亚哈就差遣人招聚以色列众人和先知都上迦密山。


王上18:21
> Elijah went before the people and said, "How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him." But the people said nothing.
>
> 以利亚前来对众民说：“你们心持两意要到几时呢?若耶和华是　神，就当顺从耶和华；若巴力是　神，就当顺从巴力。”众民一言不答。


王上18:22
> Then Elijah said to them, "I am the only one of the LORD'S prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets.
>
> 以利亚对众民说：“作耶和华先知的只剩下我一个人；巴力的先知却有四百五十个人。


王上18:23
> Get two bulls for us. Let them choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it.
>
> 当给我们两只牛犊。巴力的先知可以挑选一只，切成块子，放在柴上，不要点火；我也预备一只牛犊，放在柴上，也不点火。


王上18:24
> Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The god who answers by fire--he is God." Then all the people said, "What you say is good."
>
> 你们求告你们　神的名，我也求告耶和华的名。那降火显应的神，就是　神。”众民回答说：“这话甚好。”


王上18:25
> Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose one of the bulls and prepare it first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire."
>
> 以利亚对巴力的先知说：“你们既是人多，当先挑选一只牛犊，预备好了，就求告你们　神的名，却不要点火。”


王上18:26
> So they took the bull given them and prepared it. Then they called on the name of Baal from morning till noon. "O Baal, answer us!" they shouted. But there was no response; no one answered. And they danced around the altar they had made.
>
> 他们将所得的牛犊预备好了，从早晨到午间，求告巴力的名说：“巴力啊，求你应允我们!”却没有声音，没有应允的。他们在所筑的坛四围踊跳。


王上18:27
> At noon Elijah began to taunt them. "Shout louder!" he said. "Surely he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling. Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened."
>
> 到了正午，以利亚嬉笑他们说：“大声求告吧！因为他是　神，他或默想，或走到一边，或行路，或睡觉，你们当叫醒他。”


王上18:28
> So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until their blood flowed.
>
> 他们大声求告，按着他们的规矩，用刀枪自割自刺，直到身体流血。


王上18:29
> Midday passed, and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention.
>
> 从午后直到献晚祭的时候，他们狂呼乱叫，却没有声音，没有应允的，也没有理会的。


王上18:30
> Then Elijah said to all the people, "Come here to me." They came to him, and he repaired the altar of the LORD, which was in ruins.
>
> 以利亚对众民说：“你们到我这里来！”众民就到他那里。他便重修已经毁坏耶和华的坛。


王上18:31
> Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, "Your name shall be Israel."
>
> 以利亚照雅各子孙支派的数目，取了十二块石头（耶和华的话曾临到雅各说：“你的名要叫以色列”），


王上18:32
> With the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD, and he dug a trench around it large enough to hold two seahs of seed.
>
> 用这些石头为耶和华的名筑一座坛，在坛的四围挖沟，可容谷种二细亚，


王上18:33
> He arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces and laid it on the wood. Then he said to them, "Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood."
>
> 又在坛上摆好了柴，把牛犊切成块子放在柴上，对众人说：“你们用四个桶盛满水，倒在燔祭和柴上。”


王上18:34
> "Do it again," he said, and they did it again. "Do it a third time," he ordered, and they did it the third time.
>
> 又说：“倒第二次。”他们就倒第二次。又说：“倒第三次。”他们就倒第三次。


王上18:35
> The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench.
>
> 水流在坛的四围，沟里也满了水。


王上18:36
> At the time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed: "O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command.
>
> 到了献晚祭的时候，先知以利亚近前来说：“亚伯拉罕、以撒、以色列的　神，耶和华啊！求你今日使人知道你是以色列的　神，也知道我是你的仆人，又是奉你的命行这一切事。


王上18:37
> Answer me, O LORD, answer me, so these people will know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you are turning their hearts back again."
>
> 耶和华啊，求你应允我，应允我！使这民知道你耶和华是　神，又知道是你叫这民的心回转。”


王上18:38
> Then the fire of the LORD fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench.
>
> 于是，耶和华降下火来，烧尽燔祭、木柴、石头、尘土，又烧干沟里的水。


王上18:39
> When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, "The LORD--he is God! The LORD--he is God!"
>
> 众民看见了，就俯伏在地说：“耶和华是　神！耶和华是　神！”


王上18:40
> Then Elijah commanded them, "Seize the prophets of Baal. Don't let anyone get away!" They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there.
>
> 以利亚对他们说：“拿住巴力的先知，不容一人逃脱！”众人就拿住他们。以利亚带他们到基顺河边，在那里杀了他们。


王上18:41
> And Elijah said to Ahab, "Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain."
>
> 以利亚对亚哈说：“你现在可以上去吃喝，因为有多雨的响声了。”


王上18:42
> So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees.
>
> 亚哈就上去吃喝。以利亚上了迦密山顶，屈身在地，将脸伏在两膝之中。


王上18:43
> "Go and look toward the sea," he told his servant. And he went up and looked. "There is nothing there," he said. Seven times Elijah said, "Go back."
>
> 对仆人说：“你上去，向海观看。”仆人就上去观看说：“没有什么。”他说：“你再去观看。”如此七次。


王上18:44
> The seventh time the servant reported, "A cloud as small as a man's hand is rising from the sea." So Elijah said, "Go and tell Ahab, 'Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.'"
>
> 第七次仆人说：“我看见有一小片云从海里上来，不过如人手那样大。”以利亚说：“你上去告诉亚哈，当套车下去，免得被雨阻挡。”


王上18:45
> Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain came on and Ahab rode off to Jezreel.
>
> 霎时间，天因风云黑暗，降下大雨。亚哈就坐车往耶斯列去了。


王上18:46
> The power of the LORD came upon Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.
>
> 耶和华的灵（原文作“手”）降在以利亚身上，他就束上腰，奔在亚哈前头，直到耶斯列的城门。


## 列王纪上第19章
王上19:1
> Now Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.
>
> 亚哈将以利亚一切所行的和他用刀杀众先知的事，都告诉耶洗别。


王上19:2
> So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say, "May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them."
>
> 耶洗别就差遣人去见以利亚，告诉他说：“明日约在这时候，我若不使你的性命像那些人的性命一样，愿神明重重地降罚与我。”


王上19:3
> Elijah was afraid and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there,
>
> 以利亚见这光景，就起来逃命，到了犹大的别是巴，将仆人留在那里。


王上19:4
> while he himself went a day's journey into the desert. He came to a broom tree, sat down under it and prayed that he might die. "I have had enough, LORD," he said. "Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors."
>
> 自己在旷野走了一日的路程，来到一棵罗腾树下（“罗腾”，小树名，松类。下同）；就坐在那里求死说：“耶和华啊，罢了！求你取我的性命，因为我不胜于我的列祖。”


王上19:5
> Then he lay down under the tree and fell asleep. All at once an angel touched him and said, "Get up and eat."
>
> 他就躺在罗腾树下睡着了。有一个天使拍他说：“起来吃吧！”


王上19:6
> He looked around, and there by his head was a cake of bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank and then lay down again.
>
> 他观看，见头旁有一瓶水与炭火烧的饼，他就吃了喝了，仍然躺下。


王上19:7
> The angel of the LORD came back a second time and touched him and said, "Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you."
>
> 耶和华的使者第二次来拍他说：“起来吃吧！因为你当走的路甚远。”


王上19:8
> So he got up and ate and drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God.
>
> 他就起来吃了喝了，仗着这饮食的力，走了四十昼夜，到了　神的山，就是何烈山。


王上19:9
> There he went into a cave and spent the night. And the word of the LORD came to him: "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
>
> 他在那里进了一个洞，就住在洞中。耶和华的话临到他说：“以利亚啊，你在这里做什么?”


王上19:10
> He replied, "I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, broken down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too."
>
> 他说：“我为耶和华万军之神大发热心，因为以色列人背弃了你的约，毁坏了你的坛，用刀杀了你的先知，只剩下我一个人，他们还要寻索我的命。”


王上19:11
> The LORD said, "Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the LORD, for the LORD is about to pass by." Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake.
>
> 耶和华说：“你出来站在山上，在我面前。”那时，耶和华从那里经过，在他面前有烈风大作，崩山碎石，耶和华却不在风中；风后地震，耶和华却不在其中；


王上19:12
> After the earthquake came a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper.
>
> 地震后有火，耶和华也不在火中；火后有微小的声音。


王上19:13
> When Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave. Then a voice said to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
>
> 以利亚听见，就用外衣蒙上脸，出来站在洞口。有声音向他说：“以利亚啊，你在这里做什么?”


王上19:14
> He replied, "I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, broken down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too."
>
> 他说：“我为耶和华万军之神大发热心，因为以色列人背弃了你的约，毁坏了你的坛，用刀杀了你的先知，只剩下我一个人，他们还要寻索我的命。”


王上19:15
> The LORD said to him, "Go back the way you came, and go to the Desert of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael king over Aram.
>
> 耶和华对他说：“你回去，从旷野往大马色去。到了那里，就要膏哈薛作亚兰王；


王上19:16
> Also, anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet.
>
> 又膏宁示的孙子耶户作以色列王；并膏亚伯米何拉人沙法的儿子以利沙作先知接续你。


王上19:17
> Jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death any who escape the sword of Jehu.
>
> 将来躲避哈薛之刀的，必被耶户所杀；躲避耶户之刀的，必被以利沙所杀。


王上19:18
> Yet I reserve seven thousand in Israel--all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal and all whose mouths have not kissed him."
>
> 但我在以色列人中为自己留下七千人，是未曾向巴力屈膝的，未曾与巴力亲嘴的。”


王上19:19
> So Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, and he himself was driving the twelfth pair. Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him.
>
> 于是，以利亚离开那里走了，遇见沙法的儿子以利沙耕地，在他前头有十二对牛，自己赶着第十二对。以利亚到他那里去，将自己的外衣搭在他身上。


王上19:20
> Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah. "Let me kiss my father and mother good-by," he said, "and then I will come with you." "Go back," Elijah replied. "What have I done to you?"
>
> 以利沙就离开牛跑到以利亚那里说：“求你容我先与父母亲嘴，然后我便跟随你。”以利亚对他说：“你回去吧！我向你做了什么呢?”


王上19:21
> So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his attendant.
>
> 以利沙就离开他回去，宰了一对牛，用套牛的器具煮肉给民吃，随后就起身跟随以利亚，服事他。


## 列王纪上第20章
王上20:1
> Now Ben-Hadad king of Aram mustered his entire army. Accompanied by thirty-two kings with their horses and chariots, he went up and besieged Samaria and attacked it.
>
> 亚兰王便哈达聚集他的全军，率领三十二个王，带着车马上来围攻撒马利亚。


王上20:2
> He sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, saying, "This is what Ben-Hadad says:
>
> 又差遣使者进城见以色列王亚哈，对他说：“便哈达如此说：


王上20:3
> 'Your silver and gold are mine, and the best of your wives and children are mine.'"
>
> ‘你的金银都要归我，你妻子儿女中最美的也要归我。’”


王上20:4
> The king of Israel answered, "Just as you say, my lord the king. I and all I have are yours."
>
> 以色列王回答说：“我主我王啊，可以依着你的话，我与我所有的都归你。”


王上20:5
> The messengers came again and said, "This is what Ben-Hadad says: 'I sent to demand your silver and gold, your wives and your children.
>
> 使者又来说：“便哈达如此说：‘我已差遣人去见你，要你将你的金银、妻子儿女都给我。


王上20:6
> But about this time tomorrow I am going to send my officials to search your palace and the houses of your officials. They will seize everything you value and carry it away.'"
>
> 但明日约在这时候，我还要差遣臣仆到你那里，搜查你的家和你仆人的家，将你眼中一切所喜爱的都拿了去。’”


王上20:7
> The king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land and said to them, "See how this man is looking for trouble! When he sent for my wives and my children, my silver and my gold, I did not refuse him."
>
> 以色列王召了国中的长老来，对他们说：“请你们看看，这人是怎样地谋害我。他先差遣人到我这里来，要我的妻子儿女和金银，我并没有推辞他。”


王上20:8
> The elders and the people all answered, "Don't listen to him or agree to his demands."
>
> 长老和百姓对王说：“不要听从他，也不要应允他。”


王上20:9
> So he replied to Ben-Hadad's messengers, "Tell my lord the king, 'Your servant will do all you demanded the first time, but this demand I cannot meet.'" They left and took the answer back to Ben-Hadad.
>
> 故此，以色列王对便哈达的使者说：“你们告诉我主我王说：‘王头一次差遣人向仆人所要的，仆人都依从；但这次所要的，我不能依从。’”使者就去回覆便哈达。


王上20:10
> Then Ben-Hadad sent another message to Ahab: "May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if enough dust remains in Samaria to give each of my men a handful."
>
> 便哈达又差遣人去见亚哈说：“撒马利亚的尘土，若够跟从我的人每人捧一捧的，愿神明重重地降罚与我！”


王上20:11
> The king of Israel answered, "Tell him: 'One who puts on his armor should not boast like one who takes it off.'"
>
> 以色列王说：“你告诉他说：‘才顶盔贯甲的，休要像摘盔卸甲的夸口。’”


王上20:12
> Ben-Hadad heard this message while he and the kings were drinking in their tents, and he ordered his men: "Prepare to attack." So they prepared to attack the city.
>
> 便哈达和诸王正在帐幕里喝酒，听见这话，就对他臣仆说：“摆队吧！”他们就摆队攻城。


王上20:13
> Meanwhile a prophet came to Ahab king of Israel and announced, "This is what the LORD says: 'Do you see this vast army? I will give it into your hand today, and then you will know that I am the LORD.'"
>
> 有一个先知来见以色列王亚哈说：“耶和华如此说：‘这一大群人你看见了吗?今日我必将他们交在你手里，你就知道我是耶和华。’”


王上20:14
> "But who will do this?" asked Ahab. The prophet replied, "This is what the LORD says: 'The young officers of the provincial commanders will do it.'" "And who will start the battle?" he asked. The prophet answered, "You will."
>
> 亚哈说：“藉着谁呢?”他回答说：“耶和华说：‘藉着跟从省长的少年人。’”亚哈说：“要谁率领呢?”他说：“要你亲自率领。”


王上20:15
> So Ahab summoned the young officers of the provincial commanders, 232 men. Then he assembled the rest of the Israelites, 7,000 in all.
>
> 于是，亚哈数点跟从省长的少年人，共有二百三十二名。后又数点以色列的众兵，共有七千名。


王上20:16
> They set out at noon while Ben-Hadad and the 32 kings allied with him were in their tents getting drunk.
>
> 午间，他们就出城。便哈达和帮助他的三十二个王，正在帐幕里痛饮。


王上20:17
> The young officers of the provincial commanders went out first. Now Ben-Hadad had dispatched scouts, who reported, "Men are advancing from Samaria."
>
> 跟从省长的少年人先出城。便哈达差遣人去探望，他们回报说：“有人从撒马利亚出来了。”


王上20:18
> He said, "If they have come out for peace, take them alive; if they have come out for war, take them alive."
>
> 他说：“他们若为讲和出来，要活捉他们；若为打仗出来，也要活捉他们。”


王上20:19
> The young officers of the provincial commanders marched out of the city with the army behind them
>
> 跟从省长的少年人出城，军兵跟随他们，


王上20:20
> and each one struck down his opponent. At that, the Arameans fled, with the Israelites in pursuit. But Ben-Hadad king of Aram escaped on horseback with some of his horsemen.
>
> 各人遇见敌人就杀。亚兰人逃跑；以色列人追赶他们。亚兰王便哈达骑着马和马兵一同逃跑。


王上20:21
> The king of Israel advanced and overpowered the horses and chariots and inflicted heavy losses on the Arameans.
>
> 以色列王出城攻打车马，大大击杀亚兰人。


王上20:22
> Afterward, the prophet came to the king of Israel and said, "Strengthen your position and see what must be done, because next spring the king of Aram will attack you again."
>
> 那先知来见以色列王，对他说：“你当自强，留心怎样防备，因为到明年这时候，亚兰王必上来攻击你。”


王上20:23
> Meanwhile, the officials of the king of Aram advised him, "Their gods are gods of the hills. That is why they were too strong for us. But if we fight them on the plains, surely we will be stronger than they.
>
> 亚兰王的臣仆对亚兰王说：“以色列人的　神是山　神，所以他们胜过我们，但在平原与他们打仗，我们必定得胜。


王上20:24
> Do this: Remove all the kings from their commands and replace them with other officers.
>
> 王当这样行：把诸王革去，派军长代替他们；


王上20:25
> You must also raise an army like the one you lost--horse for horse and chariot for chariot--so we can fight Israel on the plains. Then surely we will be stronger than they." He agreed with them and acted accordingly.
>
> 又照着王丧失军兵之数，再招募一军，马补马，车补车，我们在平原与他们打仗，必定得胜。”王便听臣仆的话去行。


王上20:26
> The next spring Ben-Hadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.
>
> 次年，便哈达果然点齐亚兰人上亚弗去，要与以色列人打仗。


王上20:27
> When the Israelites were also mustered and given provisions, they marched out to meet them. The Israelites camped opposite them like two small flocks of goats, while the Arameans covered the countryside.
>
> 以色列人也点齐军兵，预备食物，迎着亚兰人出去，对着他们安营，好像两小群山羊羔。亚兰人却满了地面。


王上20:28
> The man of God came up and told the king of Israel, "This is what the LORD says: 'Because the Arameans think the LORD is a god of the hills and not a god of the valleys, I will deliver this vast army into your hands, and you will know that I am the LORD.'"
>
> 有神人来见以色列王说：“耶和华如此说：‘亚兰人既说我耶和华是山　神，不是平原的　神，所以我必将这一大群人都交在你手中，你们就知道我是耶和华。’”


王上20:29
> For seven days they camped opposite each other, and on the seventh day the battle was joined. The Israelites inflicted a hundred thousand casualties on the Aramean foot soldiers in one day.
>
> 以色列人与亚兰人相对安营七日，到第七日两军交战。那一日，以色列人杀了亚兰人步兵十万，


王上20:30
> The rest of them escaped to the city of Aphek, where the wall collapsed on twenty-seven thousand of them. And Ben-Hadad fled to the city and hid in an inner room.
>
> 其余的逃入亚弗城，城墙塌倒，压死剩下的二万七千人。便哈达也逃入城，藏在严密的屋子里。


王上20:31
> His officials said to him, "Look, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful. Let us go to the king of Israel with sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads. Perhaps he will spare your life."
>
> 他的臣仆对他说：“我们听说以色列王都是仁慈的王，现在我们不如腰束麻布，头套绳索，出去投降以色列王，或者他存留王的性命。”


王上20:32
> Wearing sackcloth around their waists and ropes around their heads, they went to the king of Israel and said, "Your servant Ben-Hadad says: 'Please let me live.'" The king answered, "Is he still alive? He is my brother."
>
> 于是他们腰束麻布，头套绳索，去见以色列王，说：“王的仆人便哈达说：‘求王存留我的性命。’”亚哈说：“他还活着吗？他是我的兄弟。”


王上20:33
> The men took this as a good sign and were quick to pick up his word. "Yes, your brother Ben-Hadad!" they said. "Go and get him," the king said. When Ben-Hadad came out, Ahab had him come up into his chariot.
>
> 这些人留心探出他的口气来，便急忙就着他的话说：“便哈达是王的兄弟。”王说：“你们去请他来。”便哈达出来见王，王就请他上车。


王上20:34
> "I will return the cities my father took from your father," Ben-Hadad offered. "You may set up your own market areas in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria." Ahab said,"On the basis of a treaty I will set you free." So he made a treaty with him, and let him go.
>
> 便哈达对王说：“我父从你父那里所夺的城邑，我必归还，你可以在大马色立街市，像我父在撒玛利亚所立的一样。”亚哈说：“我照此立约，放你回去。”就与他立约，放他去了。


王上20:35
> By the word of the LORD one of the sons of the prophets said to his companion, "Strike me with your weapon," but the man refused.
>
> 有先知的一个门徒，奉耶和华的命对他的同伴说：“你打我吧！”那人不肯打他。


王上20:36
> So the prophet said, "Because you have not obeyed the LORD, as soon as you leave me a lion will kill you." And after the man went away, a lion found him and killed him.
>
> 他就对那人说：“你既不听从耶和华的话，你一离开我，必有狮子咬死你。”那人一离开他，果然遇见狮子，把他咬死了。


王上20:37
> The prophet found another man and said, "Strike me, please." So the man struck him and wounded him.
>
> 先知的门徒又遇见一个人，对他说：“你打我吧！”那人就打他，将他打伤。


王上20:38
> Then the prophet went and stood by the road waiting for the king. He disguised himself with his headband down over his eyes.
>
> 他就去了，用头巾蒙眼，改换面目，在路旁等候王。


王上20:39
> As the king passed by, the prophet called out to him, "Your servant went into the thick of the battle, and someone came to me with a captive and said, 'Guard this man. If he is missing, it will be your life for his life, or you must pay a talent of silver.'
>
> 王从那里经过，他向王呼叫说：“仆人在阵上的时候，有人带了一个人来，对我说：‘你看守这人，若把他失了，你的性命必代替他的性命，不然，你必交出一他连得银子来。’


王上20:40
> While your servant was busy here and there, the man disappeared." "That is your sentence," the king of Israel said. "You have pronounced it yourself."
>
> 仆人正在忙乱之间，那人就不见了。”以色列王对他说：“你自己定妥了，必照样判断你。”


王上20:41
> Then the prophet quickly removed the headband from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets.
>
> 他急忙除掉蒙眼的头巾，以色列王就认出他是一个先知。


王上20:42
> He said to the king, "This is what the LORD says: 'You have set free a man I had determined should die. Therefore it is your life for his life, your people for his people.'"
>
> 他对王说：“耶和华如此说：‘因你将我定要灭绝的人放去，你的命就必代替他的命，你的民也必代替他的民。’”


王上20:43
> Sullen and angry, the king of Israel went to his palace in Samaria.
>
> 于是，以色列王闷闷不乐地回到撒马利亚，进了他的宫。


## 列王纪上第21章
王上21:1
> Some time later there was an incident involving a vineyard belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite. The vineyard was in Jezreel, close to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
>
> 这事以后，又有一事。耶斯列人拿伯在耶斯列有一个葡萄园，靠近撒马利亚王亚哈的宫。


王上21:2
> Ahab said to Naboth, "Let me have your vineyard to use for a vegetable garden, since it is close to my palace. In exchange I will give you a better vineyard or, if you prefer, I will pay you whatever it is worth."
>
> 亚哈对拿伯说：“你将你的葡萄园给我作菜园，因为是靠近我的宫；我就把更好的葡萄园换给你，或是你要银子，我就按着价值给你。”


王上21:3
> But Naboth replied, "The LORD forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers."
>
> 拿伯对亚哈说：“我敬畏耶和华，万不敢将我先人留下的产业给你。”


王上21:4
> So Ahab went home, sullen and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite had said, "I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers." He lay on his bed sulking and refused to eat.
>
> 亚哈因耶斯列人拿伯说“我不敢将我先人留下的产业给你”，就闷闷不乐地回宫，躺在床上，转脸向内，也不吃饭。


王上21:5
> His wife Jezebel came in and asked him, "Why are you so sullen? Why won't you eat?"
>
> 王后耶洗别来问他说：“你为什么心里这样忧闷，不吃饭呢?”


王上21:6
> He answered her, "Because I said to Naboth the Jezreelite, 'Sell me your vineyard; or if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard in its place.' But he said, 'I will not give you my vineyard.'"
>
> 他回答说：“因我向耶斯列人拿伯说：‘你将你的葡萄园给我，我给你价银，或是你愿意，我就把别的葡萄园换给你。’他却说：‘我不将我的葡萄园给你。’”


王上21:7
> Jezebel his wife said, "Is this how you act as king over Israel? Get up and eat! Cheer up. I'll get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."
>
> 王后耶洗别对亚哈说：“你现在是治理以色列国不是?只管起来，心里畅畅快快地吃饭，我必将耶斯列人拿伯的葡萄园给你。”


王上21:8
> So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, placed his seal on them, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth's city with him.
>
> 于是，托亚哈的名写信，用王的印印上，送给那些与拿伯同城居住的长老贵胄。


王上21:9
> In those letters she wrote: "Proclaim a day of fasting and seat Naboth in a prominent place among the people.
>
> 信上写着说：“你们当宣告禁食，叫拿伯坐在民间的高位上。


王上21:10
> But seat two scoundrels opposite him and have them testify that he has cursed both God and the king. Then take him out and stone him to death."
>
> 又叫两个匪徒坐在拿伯对面，作见证告他说：‘你谤渎　神和王了。’随后就把他拉出去用石头打死。”


王上21:11
> So the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth's city did as Jezebel directed in the letters she had written to them.
>
> 那些与拿伯同城居住的长老贵胄，得了耶洗别的信，就照信而行，


王上21:12
> They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth in a prominent place among the people.
>
> 宣告禁食，叫拿伯坐在民间的高位上。


王上21:13
> Then two scoundrels came and sat opposite him and brought charges against Naboth before the people, saying, "Naboth has cursed both God and the king." So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death.
>
> 有两个匪徒来，坐在拿伯的对面，当着众民作见证告他说：“拿伯谤渎　神和王了！”众人就把他拉到城外，用石头打死。


王上21:14
> Then they sent word to Jezebel: "Naboth has been stoned and is dead."
>
> 于是打发人去见耶洗别说：“拿伯被石头打死了。”


王上21:15
> As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, "Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite that he refused to sell you. He is no longer alive, but dead."
>
> 耶洗别听见拿伯被石头打死，就对亚哈说：“你起来得耶斯列人拿伯不肯为价银给你的葡萄园吧!现在他已经死了。”


王上21:16
> When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up and went down to take possession of Naboth's vineyard.
>
> 亚哈听见拿伯死了，就起来，下去要得耶斯列人拿伯的葡萄园。


王上21:17
> Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite:
>
> 耶和华的话临到提斯比人以利亚说：


王上21:18
> "Go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who rules in Samaria. He is now in Naboth's vineyard, where he has gone to take possession of it.
>
> “你起来，去见住撒马利亚的以色列王亚哈。他下去要得拿伯的葡萄园，现今正在那园里。


王上21:19
> Say to him, 'This is what the LORD says: Have you not murdered a man and seized his property?' Then say to him, 'This is what the LORD says: In the place where dogs licked up Naboth's blood, dogs will lick up your blood--yes, yours!'"
>
> 你要对他说：‘耶和华如此说：你杀了人，又得他的产业吗?’又要对他说：‘耶和华如此说：狗在何处舔拿伯的血，也必在何处舔你的血。’”


王上21:20
> Ahab said to Elijah, "So you have found me, my enemy!" "I have found you," he answered, "because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of the LORD.
>
> 亚哈对以利亚说：“我仇敌啊，你找到我吗?”他回答说：“我找到你了，因为你卖了自己，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事。


王上21:21
> 'I am going to bring disaster on you. I will consume your descendants and cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel--slave or free.
>
> 耶和华说：‘我必使灾祸临到你，将你除尽，凡属你的男丁，无论困住的、自由的，都从以色列中剪除。


王上21:22
> I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and that of Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have provoked me to anger and have caused Israel to sin.'
>
> 我必使你的家像尼八的儿子耶罗波安的家，又像亚希雅的儿子巴沙的家，因为你惹我发怒，又使以色列人陷在罪里。’


王上21:23
> "And also concerning Jezebel the LORD says: 'Dogs will devour Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.'
>
> 论到耶洗别，耶和华也说：‘狗在耶斯列的外郭必吃耶洗别的肉。’


王上21:24
> "Dogs will eat those belonging to Ahab who die in the city, and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country."
>
> 凡属亚哈的人，死在城中的，必被狗吃；死在田野的，必被空中的鸟吃。”


王上21:25
> (There was never a man like Ahab, who sold himself to do evil in the eyes of the LORD, urged on by Jezebel his wife.
>
> （从来没有像亚哈的，因他自卖，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，受了王后耶洗别的耸动，


王上21:26
> He behaved in the vilest manner by going after idols, like the Amorites the LORD drove out before Israel.)
>
> 就照耶和华在以色列人面前所赶出的亚摩利人，行了最可憎恶的事，信从偶像。）


王上21:27
> When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and fasted. He lay in sackcloth and went around meekly.
>
> 亚哈听见这话，就撕裂衣服，禁食，身穿麻布，睡卧也穿着麻布，并且缓缓而行。


王上21:28
> Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite:
>
> 耶和华的话临到提斯比人以利亚说：


王上21:29
> "Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself, I will not bring this disaster in his day, but I will bring it on his house in the days of his son."
>
> “亚哈在我面前这样自卑，你看见了吗?因他在我面前自卑，他还在世的时候，我不降这祸；到他儿子的时候，我必降这祸与他的家。”


## 列王纪上第22章
王上22:1
> For three years there was no war between Aram and Israel.
>
> 亚兰国和以色列国三年没有争战。


王上22:2
> But in the third year Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to see the king of Israel.
>
> 到第三年，犹大王约沙法下去见以色列王。


王上22:3
> The king of Israel had said to his officials, "Don't you know that Ramoth Gilead belongs to us and yet we are doing nothing to retake it from the king of Aram?"
>
> 以色列王对臣仆说：“你们不知道基列的拉末是属我们的吗?我们岂可静坐不动，不从亚兰王手里夺回来吗?”


王上22:4
> So he asked Jehoshaphat, "Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth Gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."
>
> 亚哈问约沙法说：“你肯同我去攻取基列的拉末吗?”约沙法对以色列王说：“你我不分彼此，我的民与你的民一样，我的马与你的马一样。”


王上22:5
> But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, "First seek the counsel of the LORD."
>
> 约沙法对以色列王说：“请你先求问耶和华。”


王上22:6
> So the king of Israel brought together the prophets--about four hundred men--and asked them, "Shall I go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?" "Go," they answered, "for the Lord will give it into the king's hand."
>
> 于是，以色列王招聚先知，约有四百人，问他们说：“我上去攻取基列的拉末可以不可以?”他们说：“可以上去，因为主必将那城交在王的手里。”


王上22:7
> But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there not a prophet of the LORD here whom we can inquire of?"
>
> 约沙法说：“这里不是还有耶和华的先知，我们可以求问他吗?”


王上22:8
> The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, "There is still one man through whom we can inquire of the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah." "The king should not say that," Jehoshaphat replied.
>
> 以色列王对约沙法说：“还有一个人，是音拉的儿子米该雅，我们可以托他求问耶和华。只是我恨他，因为他指着我所说的预言，不说吉语，单说凶言。”约沙法说：“王不必这样说。”


王上22:9
> So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, "Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once."
>
> 以色列王就召了一个太监来说：“你快去，将音拉的儿子米该雅召来。”


王上22:10
> Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.
>
> 以色列王和犹大王约沙法在撒马利亚城门前的空场上，各穿朝服，坐在位上。所有的先知都在他们面前说预言。


王上22:11
> Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns and he declared, "This is what the LORD says: 'With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.'"
>
> 基拿拿的儿子西底家造了两个铁角，说：“耶和华如此说：‘你要用这角骶触亚兰人，直到将他们灭尽。’”


王上22:12
> All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. "Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious," they said, "for the LORD will give it into the king's hand."
>
> 所有的先知也都这样预言说：“可以上基列的拉末去，必然得胜，因为耶和华必将那城交在王的手中。”


王上22:13
> The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, "Look, as one man the other prophets are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably."
>
> 那去召米该雅的使者对米该雅说：“众先知一口同音地都向王说吉言，你不如与他们说一样的话，也说吉言。”


王上22:14
> But Micaiah said, "As surely as the LORD lives, I can tell him only what the LORD tells me."
>
> 米该雅说：“我指着永生的耶和华起誓，耶和华对我说什么，我就说什么。”


王上22:15
> When he arrived, the king asked him, "Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?" "Attack and be victorious," he answered, "for the LORD will give it into the king's hand."
>
> 米该雅到王面前，王问他说：“米该雅啊，我们上去攻取基列的拉末可以不可以？”他回答说：“可以上去，必然得胜，耶和华必将那城交在王的手中。”


王上22:16
> The king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"
>
> 王对他说：“我当嘱咐你几次，你才奉耶和华的名向我说实话呢?”


王上22:17
> Then Micaiah answered, "I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the LORD said, 'These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.'"
>
> 米该雅说：“我看见以色列众民散在山上，如同没有牧人的羊群一般。耶和华说：‘这民没有主人，他们可以平平安安地各归各家去。’”


王上22:18
> The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?"
>
> 以色列王对约沙法说：“我岂没有告诉你，这人指着我所说的预言，不说吉语，单说凶言吗?”


王上22:19
> Micaiah continued, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne with all the host of heaven standing around him on his right and on his left.
>
> 米该雅说：“你要听耶和华的话。我看见耶和华坐在宝座上，天上的万军侍立在他左右。


王上22:20
> And the LORD said, 'Who will entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?' "One suggested this, and another that.
>
> 耶和华说：‘谁去引诱亚哈上基列的拉末去阵亡呢?’这个就这样说，那个就那样说。


王上22:21
> Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD and said, 'I will entice him.'
>
> 随后有一个神灵出来，站在耶和华面前说：‘我去引诱他。’


王上22:22
> " 'By what means?' the LORD asked. " 'I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,' he said. " 'You will succeed in enticing him,' said the LORD. 'Go and do it.'
>
> 耶和华问他说：‘你用何法呢?’他说：‘我去要在他众先知口中作谎言的灵。’耶和华说：‘这样，你必能引诱他，你去如此行吧!’


王上22:23
> "So now the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours. The LORD has decreed disaster for you."
>
> 现在耶和华使谎言的灵入了你这些先知的口，并且耶和华已经命定降祸与你。”


王上22:24
> Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. "Which way did the spirit from the LORD go when he went from me to speak to you?" he asked.
>
> 基拿拿的儿子西底家前来，打米该雅的脸说：“耶和华的灵从哪里离开我与你说话呢?”


王上22:25
> Micaiah replied, "You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room."
>
> 米该雅说：“你进严密的屋子藏躲的那日，就必看见了。”


王上22:26
> The king of Israel then ordered, "Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king's son

> 以色列王说：“将米该雅带回交给邑宰亚们和王的儿子约阿施说：

王上22:28
> Micaiah declared, "If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me." Then he added, "Mark my words, all you people!"
>
> 米该雅说：“你若能平平安安地回来，那就是耶和华没有藉我说这话了。”又说：“众民哪，你们都要听!”


王上22:29
> So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.
>
> 以色列王和犹大王约沙法上基列的拉末去了。


王上22:30
> The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.

> 以色列王对约沙法说：“我要改装上阵，你可以仍穿王服。”以色列王就改装上阵。


王上22:31
> Now the king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, "Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel."

王上22:32
> When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, "Surely this is the king of Israel." So they turned to attack him, but when Jehoshaphat cried out,

> 车兵长见不是以色列王，就转去不追他了。


王上22:34
