This week I devoted to finishing the main menu UI. unfortunately, it's not all done yet, but I'm close. 
Here's what I've added to it this past week.

# Save File Sub-menu

After designing the options and quit menu last week, I wasted no time in getting the file screen design finished.
The file screen is what the player would see when they select "Load Game". Here, they can view the save slots and
choose which one to play on, be it a new save file or an existing one where they can continue their progress. I
decided to give our game a limit of 9 save files, as I felt that would be more than enough for a game of this type.

As for how the file screen would look, I took inspiration from [_Freedom Planet_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Planet), a game that I've been enjoying lately.
In that game, the files are laid out horizontally, and the player can move left and right to cycle between them. My 
prototype design for the file screen can be seen below.

The file screen, looking at these screenshots I realise I have to fix the UI's layout once and for all.

# Panel Setup

Now that I had all of my panels (sub-menus) in place, I had to begin work on allowing the player to cycle between
these panels seamlessly and robustly. This first involved my script gaining access to these menus and their properties
as soon as the game started.

Access to each sub-menu is obtained as soon as game begins.

Once I had obtained access to the menu's panels, I then created a method that would take in a string to determine 
what menu should become active. This method determines which menu is the new active menu, then it calls the UpdateMenuPanels()
method to activate that menu and ensure the others are deactivated. This method has worked perfectly for the on-click events 
of my menu buttons. The code can be seen below.

Each button that causes a panel transition utilises the aforementioned method to activate the next menu panel.

Each button that causes a panel transition utilises the aforementioned method to activate the next menu panel.

I'm quite happy with the above method as I believe it handles menu transitions very well. On top of that, the panel
setup I have implemented in my Awake() method has the pleasant side effect of starting the game with the main menu 
active, no matter which panel is active while I'm working on it in Scene Edit mode.

# Highlight Shenanigans

Finally, when my sub-menus were all set up, I had to begin the arduous process of ensuring my highlighter 
(used to denote which menu option the user is hovering over) would transition seamlessly between menus. To maintain the
menu's dynamism, I wanted the highlight to move from option to option, menu to menu, instead of simply teleporting to the
next option. I had to derive a method that ensured the highlighter would move between methods. After a lot of trials and 
tribulations, I implemented a coroutine that worked for me. The code can be seen below.

![Highlight Transfer Coroutine](/assets/img/post_images/jack_images/week-4-highlight-transfer-coroutine.png){:.lead}
This coroutine moves our highlighter to the appropriate location depending on which menu has been activated.

I managed to get the highlighter transitioning between the main menu, the options menu and the quit menu this week. First thing next week
is to allow for transfer to and from the file menu.

Side Note: I also dabbled in implementing joystick input for the menu, as well as the game in general. I'll likely be working on this after the menu's finished.

'Til next time!
