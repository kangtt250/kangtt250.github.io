# Important Notes On This Book (Disclaimer)

I built the Navalmanack entirely out of transcripts, Tweets, and talks Naval has shared. Every attempt is made to present Naval in his own words. However, there are a few important points.

我完全根据纳瓦尔分享的文字记录、推文和谈话建立了纳瓦尔马纳克。每一次尝试都是用他自己的话来呈现纳瓦尔。然而，有几点很重要。

* The transcripts have been edited for clarity and brevity (multiple times). 为清晰和简洁起见(多次)，文字记录经过了编辑。
* Not all sources are primary (some excerpts are from other writers quoting Naval). 并不是所有的资料都是第一手的(有些摘录来自其他作家引用纳瓦尔的话)。
* I can’t be 100 percent certain of every source’s authenticity. 我不能百分之百确定每个消息来源的真实性。
* Concepts and interpretations change over time, medium, and context. 概念和解释会随着时间、媒介和上下文的变化而变化。
* Please verify phrasing with a primary source before citing Naval from this text. 在引用本文中的Naval之前，请与主要来源核实措辞。
* Please interpret generously. 请慷慨地翻译。

By definition, everything in this book is taken out of context. Interpretations will change over time. Read and interpret generously. Understand the original intent may be different than your interpretation in a different time, medium, format, and context.

根据定义，这本书中的一切都是断章取义。解释会随着时间的推移而改变。宽宏大量地阅读和口译。理解原意可能与您在不同时间、不同介质、不同格式和不同背景下的解释不同。

In the process of creating this book, I may have mistakenly re -contextualized , misinterpreted, or misunderstood things. As content passed through time, space, and medium, some phrasing may have shifted in flight. Every effort has been made to maintain the original intent, but errors are (very) possible.

在创作这本书的过程中，我可能会错误地重新理解、曲解或误解了一些东西。随着内容穿越时间、空间和媒介，一些措辞可能会在飞行中发生变化。我们已经尽了一切努力来保持原意，但(很)可能会出错。

Interviews have been transcribed, edited, rearranged, and re -edited for readability. I did my best to keep Naval’s ideas in his own words.

采访内容经过转录、编辑、重新编排和重新编辑，以提高可读性。我尽了最大努力把纳瓦尔的想法用他自己的话表达出来。

All brilliance in this book is Naval’s; any mistakes are mine.

这本书里所有的才华都是纳瓦尔的，任何错误都是我的。
