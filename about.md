你若有枪，我也握着枪，那我们可以谈法律。  
If you hold a gun and I hold a gun, we can talk about the law.  

你若持着刀，我也持着刀，我们可以谈规则。  
If you hold a knife and I hold a knife, we can talk about rules.  

你我若空手而来，便能谈理性。  
If we both come empty-handed, then we can talk about reason.  

但若你有枪，而我只有刀，真理就握在你手中。  
But if you have a gun and I only a knife, the truth lies in your hand.  

若你有枪而我一无所有，你手里的不是武器，而是我的生命。  
And if you have a gun while I have nothing, what you hold is not just a weapon—it is my life.

法律、规则与道德，只有建立在平等之上才有意义。  
Law, rules, and morality only carry meaning when they are founded on equality.  

当金钱开口，真理便沉默；当权力开口，连金钱也要退后。  
When money speaks, truth falls silent; when power speaks, even money retreats.  

制定规则的人，往往最先破坏规则。  
Those who create the rules are often the first to break them.  

规则，对弱者是枷锁，对强者是工具。  
Rules are chains for the weak and tools for the strong.

这个世界上一切好处都要靠争取。  
In this world, anything good must be fought for.  

强者拼尽全力争夺资源，  
The strong fight fiercely for resources,  

而弱者只能在一旁等待施舍。  
While the weak can only sit idly, waiting for a share.

但世界的真相，不等于生命的真相。  
Yet the truth of the world is not the same as the truth of life.  

生命告诉我们：没有生命，就谈不上改变命运。  
Life tells us: without life, there is no way to change destiny.  

你若此刻杀我，明日死亡也会悄然降临你前；  
If you kill me now, tomorrow death may quietly come for you as well.  

你若用武器或法律摧毁我的未来，  
If you use weapons or law to destroy my future,  

我只能沉默注视，因为终点不会偏向任何人。  
I will watch in silence, for the end shows no favoritism.

所以，不必奢望完美的秩序。  
Therefore, do not cling to dreams of perfect order.  

法律和规则每天都在被改写，  
Laws and rules are rewritten day after day,  

而大多数政府只对无权者严苛。  
And most governments enforce them harshly only upon the powerless.  

别把“世界”与“人生”混为一谈。  
Do not confuse the “world” with “life.”  

活好上帝赐予的时光，不要恐惧。  
Live the time God has given you, without fear.  

把世间看作考验，而不是判决。  
Take the world as a challenge, not a sentence.  

你是自己生命的主人，但你终究不会永生。  
You are the master of your own life, but you will not live forever.  

—— 阿门 / Amen
