Gad and Asher.<p>但、拿弗他利、迦得、亚设。</blockquote><p>出1:5<blockquote><p>The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy in all; Joseph was already in Egypt.<p>凡从雅各而生的，共有七十人；约瑟已经在埃及。</blockquote><p>出1:6<blockquote><p>Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,<p>约瑟和他的弟兄，并那一代的人都死了。</blockquote><p>出1:7<blockquote><p>but the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them.<p>以色列人生养众多，并且繁茂，极其强盛，满了那地。</blockquote><p>出1:8<blockquote><p>Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.<p>有不认识约瑟的新王起来，治理埃及。</blockquote><p>出1:9<blockquote><p>“Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become much too numerous for us.<p>对他的百姓说：“看哪，这以色列民比我们还多，又比我们强盛。</blockquote><p>出1:10<blockquote><p>Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.”<p>来吧！我们不如用巧计待他们，恐怕他们多起来，日后若遇什么争战的事，就连合我们的仇敌攻击我们，离开这地去了。”</blockquote><p>出1:11<blockquote><p>So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.<p>于是埃及人派督工的辖制他们，加重担苦害他们。他们为法老建造两座积货城，就是比东和兰塞。</blockquote><p>出1:12<blockquote><p>But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites<p>只是越发苦害他们，他们越发多起来，越发蔓延，埃及人就因以色列人愁烦。</blockquote><p>出1:13<blockquote><p>and worked them ruthlessly.<p>埃及人严严地使以色列人作工，</blockquote><p>出1:14<blockquote><p>They made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.<p>使他们因作苦工觉得命苦；无论是和泥，是做砖，是作田间各样的工，在一切的工上都严严地待他们。</blockquote><p>出1:15<blockquote><p>The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,<p>有希伯来的两个收生婆，一名施弗拉，一名普阿。埃及王对她们说：</blockquote><p>出1:16<blockquote><p>“When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live.”<p>“你们为希伯来妇人收生，看她们临盆的时候，若是男孩，就把他杀了；若是女孩，就留她存活。”</blockquote><p>出1:17<blockquote><p>The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live.<p>但是收生婆敬畏　神，不照埃及王的吩咐行，竟存留男孩的性命。</blockquote><p>出1:18<blockquote><p>Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?”<p>埃及王召了收生婆来说：“你们为什么作这事，存留男孩的性命呢？”</blockquote><p>出1:19<blockquote><p>The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.”<p>收生婆对法老说：“因为希伯来妇人与埃及妇人不同，希伯来妇人本是健壮的（原文作“活泼的”），收生婆还没有到，她们已经生产了。”</blockquote><p>出1:20<blockquote><p>So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous.<p>神厚待收生婆。以色列人多起来，极其强盛。</blockquote><p>出1:21<blockquote><p>And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.<p>收生婆因为敬畏　神，　神便叫她们成立家室。</blockquote><p>出1:22<blockquote><p>Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Every boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.”<p>法老吩咐他的众民说：“以色列人所生的男孩，你们都要丢在河里；一切的女孩，你们要存留她的性命。”</blockquote><h2 id="出埃及记第2章">出埃及记第2章</h2><p>出2:1<blockquote><p>Now a man of the house of Levi married a Levite woman,<p>有一个利未家的人，娶了一个利未女子为妻。</blockquote><p>出2:2<blockquote><p>and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months.<p>那女人怀孕，生一个儿子，见他俊美，就藏了他三个月。</blockquote><p>出2:3<blockquote><p>But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.<p>后来不能再藏，就取了一个蒲草箱，抹上石漆和石油，将孩子放在里头，把箱子搁在河边的芦荻中。</blockquote><p>出2:4<blockquote><p>His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.<p>孩子的姐姐远远站着，要知道他究竟怎么样。</blockquote><p>出2:5<blockquote><p>Then Pharaoh’s daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the river bank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her slave girl to get it.<p>法老的女儿来到河边洗澡，她的使女们在河边行走。她看见箱子在芦荻中，就打发一个婢女拿来。</blockquote><p>出2:6<blockquote><p>She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. “This is one of the Hebrew babies,” she said.<p>她打开箱子，看见那孩子。孩子哭了，她就可怜他说：“这是希伯来人的一个孩子。”</blockquote><p>出2:7<blockquote><p>Then his sister asked Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?”<p>孩子的姐姐对法老的女儿说：“我去在希伯来妇人中，叫一个奶妈来，为你奶这孩子，可以不可以？”</blockquote><p>出2:8<blockquote><p>“Yes, go,” she answered. And the girl went and got the baby’s mother.<p>法老的女儿说：“可以。”童女就去叫了孩子的母亲来。</blockquote><p>出2:9<blockquote><p>Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.” So the woman took the baby and nursed him.<p>法老的女儿对她说：“你把这孩子抱去，为我奶他，我必给你工价。”妇人就抱了孩子去奶他。</blockquote><p>出2:10<blockquote><p>When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses, saying, “I drew him out of the water.”<p>孩子渐长，妇人把他带到法老的女儿那里，就作了她的儿子。她给孩子起名叫摩西，意思说：“因我把他从水里拉出来。”</blockquote><p>出2:11<blockquote><p>One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.<p>后来摩西长大，他出去到他弟兄那里，看他们的重担，见一个埃及人打希伯来人的一个弟兄。</blockquote><p>出2:12<blockquote><p>Glancing this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.<p>他左右观看，见没有人，就把埃及人打死了，藏在沙土里。</blockquote><p>出2:13<blockquote><p>The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?”<p>第二天他出去，见有两个希伯来人争斗，就对那欺负人的说：“你为什么打你同族的人呢？”</blockquote><p>出2:14<blockquote><p>The man said, “Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and thought, “What I did must have become known.”<p>那人说：“谁立你作我们的首领和审判官呢？难道你要杀我，像杀那埃及人吗？”摩西便惧怕，说：“这事必是被人知道了。”</blockquote><p>出2:15<blockquote><p>When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well.<p>法老听见这事，就想杀摩西，但摩西躲避法老，逃往米甸地居住。</blockquote><p>出2:16<blockquote><p>Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father’s flock.<p>一日，他在井旁坐下，米甸的祭司有七个女儿，她们来打水，打满了槽，要饮父亲的群羊。</blockquote><p>出2:17<blockquote><p>Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock.<p>有牧羊的人来把她们赶走了，摩西却起来帮助她们，又饮了她们的群羊。</blockquote><p>出2:18<blockquote><p>When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, “Why have you returned so early today?”<p>她们来到父亲流珥那里，他说：“今日你们为何来得这么快呢？”</blockquote><p>出2:19<blockquote><p>They answered, “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock.”<p>她们说：“有一个埃及人救我们脱离牧羊人的手，并且为我们打水饮了群羊。”</blockquote><p>出2:20<blockquote><p>“And where is he?” he asked his daughters. “Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat.”<p>他对女儿们说：“那个人在哪里？你们为什么撇下他呢？你们去请他来吃饭。”</blockquote><p>出2:21<blockquote><p>Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.<p>摩西甘心和那人同住；那人把他的女儿西坡拉给摩西为妻。</blockquote><p>出2:22<blockquote><p>Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, saying, “I have become an alien in a foreign land.”<p>西坡拉生了一个儿子，摩西给他起名叫革舜，意思说：“因我在外邦作了寄居的。”</blockquote><p>出2:23<blockquote><p>During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God.<p>过了多年，埃及王死了。以色列人因作苦工，就叹息哀求，他们的哀声达于　神。</blockquote><p>出2:24<blockquote><p>God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob.<p>神听见他们的哀声，就记念他与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各所立的约。</blockquote><p>出2:25<blockquote><p>So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them.<p>神看顾以色列人，也知道他们的苦情。</blockquote><h2 id="出埃及记第3章">出埃及记第3章</h2><p>出3:1<blockquote><p>Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.<p>摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群。一日，领羊群往野外去，到了　神的山，就是何烈山，</blockquote><p>出3:2<blockquote><p>There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.<p>耶和华的使者从荆棘里火焰中向摩西显现。摩西观看，不料，荆棘被火烧着，却没有烧毁。</blockquote><p>出3:3<blockquote><p>So Moses thought, “I will go over and see this strange sight–why the bush does not burn up.”<p>摩西说：“我要过去看这大异象，这荆棘为何没有烧坏呢？”</blockquote><p>出3:4<blockquote><p>When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, “Moses! Moses!” And Moses said, “Here I am.”<p>耶和华　神见他过去要看，就从荆棘里呼叫说：“摩西！摩西！”他说：“我在这里。”</blockquote><p>出3:5<blockquote><p>“Do not come any closer,” God said. “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.”<p>神说：“不要近前来，当把你脚上的鞋脱下来，因为你所站之地是圣地。”</blockquote><p>出3:6<blockquote><p>Then he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.” At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.<p>又说：“我是你父亲的　神，是亚伯拉罕的　神，以撒的　神，雅各的　神。”摩西蒙上脸，因为怕看　神。</blockquote><p>出3:7<blockquote><p>The LORD said, “I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering.<p>耶和华说：“我的百姓在埃及所受的困苦，我实在看见了；他们因受督工的辖制所发的哀声，我也听见了。我原知道他们的痛苦。</blockquote><p>出3:8<blockquote><p>So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey–the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.<p>我下来是要救他们脱离埃及人的手，领他们出了那地，到美好宽阔流奶与蜜之地，就是到迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人之地。</blockquote><p>出3:9<blockquote><p>And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.<p>现在以色列人的哀声达到我耳中，我也看见埃及人怎样欺压他们。</blockquote><p>出3:10<blockquote><p>So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.”<p>故此，我要打发你去见法老，使你可以将我的百姓以色列人从埃及领出来。”</blockquote><p>出3:11<blockquote><p>But Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”<p>摩西对　神说：“我是什么人，竟能去见法老，将以色列人从埃及领出来呢？”</blockquote><p>出3:12<blockquote><p>And God said, “I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain.”<p>神说：“我必与你同在。你将百姓从埃及领出来之后，你们必在这山上事奉我，这就是我打发你去的证据。”</blockquote><p>出3:13<blockquote><p>Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?”<p>摩西对　神说：“我到以色列人那里，对他们说：‘你们祖宗的　神打发我到你们这里来。’他们若问我说：‘他叫什么名字？’我要对他们说什么呢？”</blockquote><p>出3:14<blockquote><p>God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”<p>神对摩西说：“我是自有永有的。”又说：“你要对以色列人这样说：‘那自有的打发我到你们这里来。’”</blockquote><p>出3:15<blockquote><p>God also said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers–the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob–has sent me to you.’ This is my name forever, the name by which I am to be remembered from generation to generation.<p>神又对摩西说：“你要对以色列人这样说：‘耶和华你们祖宗的　神，就是亚伯拉罕的　神，以撒的　神，雅各的　神，打发我到你们这里来。耶和华是我的名，直到永远；这也是我的纪念，直到万代。’</blockquote><p>出3:16<blockquote><p>“Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers–the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob–appeared to me and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.<p>你去招聚以色列的长老，对他们说：‘耶和华你们祖宗的　神，就是亚伯拉罕的　神，以撒的　神，雅各的　神，向我显现，说：我实在眷顾了你们，我也看见埃及人怎样待你们。</blockquote><p>出3:17<blockquote><p>And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites–a land flowing with milk and honey.’<p>我也说要将你们从埃及的困苦中领出来，往迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人的地去，就是到流奶与蜜之地。’</blockquote><p>出3:18<blockquote><p>“The elders of Israel will listen to you.

Their anointing will be to a priesthood that will continue for all generations to come.”<p>怎样膏他们的父亲，也要照样膏他们，使他们给我供祭司的职分。他们世世代代凡受膏的，就永远当祭司的职任。”</blockquote><p>出40:16<blockquote><p>Moses did everything just as the LORD commanded him.<p>摩西这样行，都是照耶和华所吩咐他的。</blockquote><p>出40:17<blockquote><p>So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month in the second year.<p>第二年正月初一日，帐幕就立起来。</blockquote><p>出40:18<blockquote><p>When Moses set up the tabernacle, he put the bases in place, erected the frames, inserted the crossbars and set up the posts.<p>摩西立起帐幕，安上带卯的座，立上板，穿上闩，立起柱子；</blockquote><p>出40:19<blockquote><p>Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent, as the LORD commanded him.<p>在帐幕以上搭罩棚，把罩棚的顶盖，盖在其上，是照耶和华所吩咐他的。</blockquote><p>出40:20<blockquote><p>He took the Testimony and placed it in the ark, attached the poles to the ark and put the atonement cover over it.<p>又把法版放在柜里，把杠穿在柜的两旁，把施恩座安在柜上。</blockquote><p>出40:21<blockquote><p>Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle and hung the shielding curtain and shielded the ark of the Testimony, as the LORD commanded him.<p>把柜抬进帐幕，挂上遮掩柜的幔子，把法柜遮掩了，是照耶和华所吩咐他的。</blockquote><p>出40:22<blockquote><p>Moses placed the table in the Tent of Meeting on the north side of the tabernacle outside the curtain<p>又把桌子安在会幕内，在帐幕北边，在幔子外。</blockquote><p>出40:23<blockquote><p>and set out the bread on it before the LORD, as the LORD commanded him.<p>在桌子上将饼陈设在耶和华面前，是照耶和华所吩咐他的。</blockquote><p>出40:24<blockquote><p>He placed the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle<p>又把灯台安在会幕内，在帐幕南边，与桌子相对，</blockquote><p>出40:25<blockquote><p>and set up the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD commanded him.<p>在耶和华面前点灯，是照耶和华所吩咐他的。</blockquote><p>出40:26<blockquote><p>Moses placed the gold altar in the Tent of Meeting in front of the curtain<p>把金坛安在会幕内的幔子前，</blockquote><p>出40:27<blockquote><p>and burned fragrant incense on it, as the LORD commanded him.<p>在坛上烧了馨香料作的香，是照耶和华所吩咐他的。</blockquote><p>出40:28<blockquote><p>Then he put up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.<p>又挂上帐幕的门帘。</blockquote><p>出40:29<blockquote><p>He set the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it burnt offerings and grain offerings, as the LORD commanded him.<p>在会幕的帐幕门前，安设燔祭坛，把燔祭和素祭献在其上，是照耶和华所吩咐他的。</blockquote><p>出40:30<blockquote><p>He placed the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing,<p>把洗濯盆安在会幕和坛的中间，盆中盛水，以便洗濯。</blockquote><p>出40:31<blockquote><p>and Moses and Aaron and his sons used it to wash their hands and feet.<p>摩西和亚伦并亚伦的儿子，在这盆里洗手洗脚。</blockquote><p>出40:32<blockquote><p>They washed whenever they entered the Tent of Meeting or approached the altar, as the LORD commanded Moses.<p>他们进会幕或就近坛的时候，便都洗濯，是照耶和华所吩咐他的。</blockquote><p>出40:33<blockquote><p>Then Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar and put up the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. And so Moses finished the work.<p>在帐幕和坛的四围，立了院帷，把院子的门帘挂上。这样，摩西就完了工。</blockquote><p>出40:34<blockquote><p>Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.<p>当时，云彩遮盖会幕，耶和华的荣光就充满了帐幕。</blockquote><p>出40:35<blockquote><p>Moses could not enter the Tent of Meeting because the cloud had settled upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.<p>摩西不能进会幕，因为云彩停在其上，并且耶和华的荣光充满了帐幕。</blockquote><p>出40:36<blockquote><p>In all the travels of the Israelites, whenever the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle, they would set out;<p>每逢云彩从帐幕收上去，以色列人就起程前往；</blockquote><p>出40:37<blockquote><p>but if the cloud did not lift, they did not set out–until the day it lifted.<p>云彩若不收上去，他们就不起程，直等到云彩收上去。</blockquote><p>出40:38<blockquote><p>So the cloud of the LORD was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel during all their travels.<p>日间，耶和华的云彩是在帐幕以上；夜间，云中有火，在以色列全家的眼前，在他们所行的路上都是这样。</blockquote></article><footer role="contentinfo"><hr/><p><small class="copyright">© Seon Zhu 2022.
