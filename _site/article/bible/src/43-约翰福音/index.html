without him nothing was made that has been made.<p>万物是藉着他造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着他造的。</blockquote><p>约1:4<blockquote><p>In him was life, and that life was the light of men.<p>生命在他里头，这生命就是人的光。</blockquote><p>约1:5<blockquote><p>The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it.<p>光照在黑暗里，黑暗却不接受光。</blockquote><p>约1:6<blockquote><p>There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John.<p>有一个人，是从　神那里差来的，名叫约翰。</blockquote><p>约1:7<blockquote><p>He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe.<p>这人来，为要作见证，就是为光作见证，叫众人因他可以信。</blockquote><p>约1:8<blockquote><p>He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.<p>他不是那光，乃是要为光作见证。</blockquote><p>约1:9<blockquote><p>The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world.<p>那光是真光，照亮一切生在世上的人。</blockquote><p>约1:10<blockquote><p>He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.<p>他在世界，世界也是藉着他造的，世界却不认识他。</blockquote><p>约1:11<blockquote><p>He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.<p>他到自己的地方来，自己的人倒不接待他。</blockquote><p>约1:12<blockquote><p>Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God–<p>凡接待他的，就是信他名的人，他就赐他们权柄，作　神的儿女。</blockquote><p>约1:13<blockquote><p>children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God.<p>这等人不是从血气生的，不是从情欲生的，也不是从人意生的，乃是从　神生的。</blockquote><p>约1:14<blockquote><p>The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.<p>道成了肉身，住在我们中间，充充满满地有恩典，有真理。我们也见过他的荣光，正是父独生子的荣光。</blockquote><p>约1:15<blockquote><p>John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.’”<p>约翰为他作见证，喊着说：“这就是我曾说：‘那在我以后来的，反成了在我以前的，因他本来在我以前。’”</blockquote><p>约1:16<blockquote><p>From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another.<p>从他丰满的恩典里，我们都领受了，而且恩上加恩。</blockquote><p>约1:17<blockquote><p>For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.<p>律法本是藉着摩西传的，恩典和真理都是由耶稣基督来的。</blockquote><p>约1:18<blockquote><p>No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only, who is at the Father’s side, has made him known.<p>从来没有人看见　神，只有在父怀里的独生子将他表明出来。</blockquote><p>约1:19<blockquote><p>Now this was John’s testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was.<p>约翰所作的见证记在下面：犹太人从耶路撒冷差祭司和利未人到约翰那里，问他说：“你是谁？”</blockquote><p>约1:20<blockquote><p>He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, “I am not the Christ.”<p>他就明说，并不隐瞒；明说：“我不是基督。”</blockquote><p>约1:21<blockquote><p>They asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” He answered, “No.”<p>他们又问他说：“这样，你是谁呢？是以利亚吗？”他说：“我不是。”“是那先知吗？”他回答说：“不是。”</blockquote><p>约1:22<blockquote><p>Finally they said, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”<p>于是他们说：“你到底是谁？叫我们好回覆差我们来的人。你自己说，你是谁？”</blockquote><p>约1:23<blockquote><p>John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, “I am the voice of one calling in the desert, ‘Make straight the way for the Lord.’”<p>他说：“我就是那在旷野有人声喊着说：‘修直主的道路’，正如先知以赛亚所说的。”</blockquote><p>约1:24<blockquote><p>Now some Pharisees who had been sent<p>那些人是法利赛人差来的（或作“那差来的是法利赛人”）。</blockquote><p>约1:25<blockquote><p>questioned him, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”<p>他们就问他说：“你既不是基督，不是以利亚，也不是那先知，为什么施洗呢？”</blockquote><p>约1:26<blockquote><p>“I baptize with water,” John replied, “but among you stands one you do not know.<p>约翰回答说：“我是用水施洗，但有一位站在你们中间，是你们不认识的，</blockquote><p>约1:27<blockquote><p>He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.”<p>就是那在我以后来的，我给他解鞋带也不配。”</blockquote><p>约1:28<blockquote><p>This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.<p>这是在约旦河外伯大尼（有古卷作“伯大巴喇”），约翰施洗的地方作的见证。</blockquote><p>约1:29<blockquote><p>The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!<p>次日，约翰看见耶稣来到他那里，就说：“看哪，　神的羔羊，除去（或作“背负”）世人罪孽的。</blockquote><p>约1:30<blockquote><p>This is the one I meant when I said, ‘A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.’<p>这就是我曾说‘有一位在我以后来，反成了在我以前的，因他本来在我以前。’</blockquote><p>约1:31<blockquote><p>I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.”<p>我先前不认识他，如今我来用水施洗，为要叫他显明给以色列人。”</blockquote><p>约1:32<blockquote><p>Then John gave this testimony: “I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.<p>约翰又作见证说：“我曾看见圣灵仿佛鸽子从天降下，住在他的身上。</blockquote><p>约1:33<blockquote><p>I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’<p>我先前不认识他，只是那差我来用水施洗的，对我说：‘你看见圣灵降下来，住在谁的身上，谁就是用圣灵施洗的。’</blockquote><p>约1:34<blockquote><p>I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.”<p>我看见了，就证明这是　神的儿子。”</blockquote><p>约1:35<blockquote><p>The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.<p>再次日，约翰同两个门徒站在那里。</blockquote><p>约1:36<blockquote><p>When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”<p>他见耶稣行走，就说：“看哪，这是　神的羔羊!”</blockquote><p>约1:37<blockquote><p>When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.<p>两个门徒听见他的话，就跟从了耶稣。</blockquote><p>约1:38<blockquote><p>Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, “What do you want?” They said, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are you staying?”<p>耶稣转过身来，看见他们跟着，就问他们说：“你们要什么？”他们说：“拉比（“拉比”翻出来就是“夫子”），在哪里住？”</blockquote><p>约1:39<blockquote><p>“Come,” he replied, “and you will see.” So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour.<p>耶稣说：“你们来看。”他们就去看他在哪里住，这一天便与他同住。那时约有申正了。</blockquote><p>约1:40<blockquote><p>Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus.<p>听见约翰的话，跟从耶稣的那两个人，一个是西门彼得的兄弟安得烈。</blockquote><p>约1:41<blockquote><p>The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, “We have found the Messiah” (that is, the Christ).<p>他先找着自己的哥哥西门，对他说：“我们遇见弥赛亚了（“弥赛亚”翻出来就是“基督”）！”</blockquote><p>约1:42<blockquote><p>And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which, when translated, is Peter).<p>于是领他去见耶稣。耶稣看着他说：“你是约翰的儿子西门（“约翰”马太16章17节称“约拿”），你要称为矶法（“矶法”翻出来就是“彼得”）。”</blockquote><p>约1:43<blockquote><p>The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, “Follow me.”<p>又次日，耶稣想要往加利利去，遇见腓力，就对他说：“来，跟从我吧!”</blockquote><p>约1:44<blockquote><p>Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.<p>这腓力是伯赛大人，和安得烈、彼得同城。</blockquote><p>约1:45<blockquote><p>Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote–Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”<p>腓力找着拿但业，对他说：“摩西在律法上所写的和众先知所记的那一位，我们遇见了，就是约瑟的儿子拿撒勒人耶稣。”</blockquote><p>约1:46<blockquote><p>“Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?” Nathanael asked. “Come and see,” said Philip.<p>拿但业对他说：“拿撒勒还能出什么好的吗？”腓力说：“你来看！”</blockquote><p>约1:47<blockquote><p>When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, “Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.”<p>耶稣看见拿但业来，就指着他说：“看哪，这是个真以色列人，他心里是没有诡诈的。”</blockquote><p>约1:48<blockquote><p>“How do you know me?” Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, “I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.”<p>拿但业对耶稣说：“你从哪里知道我呢？”耶稣回答说：“腓力还没有招呼你，你在无花果树底下，我就看见你了。”</blockquote><p>约1:49<blockquote><p>Then Nathanael declared, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.”<p>拿但业说：“拉比，你是　神的儿子，你是以色列的王！”</blockquote><p>约1:50<blockquote><p>Jesus said, “You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that.”<p>耶稣对他说：“因为我说在无花果树底下看见你，你就信吗？你将要看见比这更大的事。”</blockquote><p>约1:51<blockquote><p>He then added, “I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”<p>又说：“我实实在在的告诉你们，你们将要看见天开了，　神的使者上去下来在人子身上。”</blockquote><h2 id="约翰福音第2章">约翰福音第2章</h2><p>约2:1<blockquote><p>On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there,<p>第三日，在加利利的迦拿有娶亲的筵席，耶稣的母亲在那里。</blockquote><p>约2:2<blockquote><p>and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.<p>耶稣和他的门徒也被请去赴席。</blockquote><p>约2:3<blockquote><p>When the wine was gone, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no more wine.”<p>酒用尽了，耶稣的母亲对他说：“他们没有酒了。”</blockquote><p>约2:4<blockquote><p>“Dear woman, why do you involve me?” Jesus replied. “My time has not yet come.”<p>耶稣说：“母亲（原文作“妇人”），我与你有什么相干？我的时候还没有到。”</blockquote><p>约2:5<blockquote><p>His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”<p>他母亲对用人说：“他告诉你们什么，你们就做什么。”</blockquote><p>约2:6<blockquote><p>Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons.<p>照犹太人洁净的规矩，有六口石缸摆在那里，每口可以盛两三桶水。</blockquote><p>约2:7<blockquote><p>Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water”; so they filled them to the brim.<p>耶稣对用人说：“把缸倒满了水。”他们就倒满了，直到缸口。</blockquote><p>约2:8<blockquote><p>Then he told them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.” They did so,<p>耶稣又说：“现在可以舀出来，送给管筵席的。”他们就送了去。</blockquote><p>约2:9<blockquote><p>and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside<p>管筵席的尝了那水变的酒，并不知道是哪里来的，只有舀水的用人知道。管筵席的便叫新郎来，</blockquote><p>约2:10<blockquote><p>and said, “Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now.”<p>对他说：“人都是先摆上好酒，等客喝足了，才摆上次的；你倒把好酒留到如今！”</blockquote><p>约2:11<blockquote><p>This, the first of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee. He thus revealed his glory, and his disciples put their faith in him.<p>这是耶稣所行的头一件神迹，是在加利利的迦拿行的，显出他的荣耀来，他的门徒就信他了。</blockquote><p>约2:12<blockquote><p>After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days.<p>这事以后，耶稣与他的母亲、弟兄和门徒都下迦百农去，在那里住了不多几日。</blockquote><p>约2:13<blockquote><p>When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.<p>犹太人的逾越节近了，耶稣就上耶路撒冷去。</blockquote><p>约2:14<blockquote><p>In the temple courts he found men selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money.<p>看见殿里有卖牛、羊、鸽子的，并有兑换银钱的人坐在那里。</blockquote><p>约2:15<blockquote><p>So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple area, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.<p>耶稣就拿绳子做成鞭子，把牛羊都赶出殿去，倒出兑换银钱之人的银钱，推翻他们的桌子。</blockquote><p>约2:16<blockquote><p>To those who sold doves he said, “Get these out of here!

They said, “When the Christ comes, will he do more miraculous signs than this man?”<p>但众人中间有好些信他的，说：“基督来的时候，他所行的神迹岂能比这人所行的更多吗？”</blockquote><p>约7:32<blockquote><p>The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him.<p>法利赛人听见众人为耶稣这样纷纷议论，祭司长和法利赛人就打发差役去捉拿他。</blockquote><p>约7:33<blockquote><p>Jesus said, “I am with you for only a short time, and then I go to the one who sent me.<p>于是耶稣说：“我还有不多的时候和你们同在，以后就回到差我来的那里去。</blockquote><p>约7:34<blockquote><p>You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come.”<p>你们要找我，却找不着；我所在的地方，你们不能到。”</blockquote><p>约7:35<blockquote><p>The Jews said to one another, “Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?<p>犹太人就彼此对问说：“这人要往哪里去，叫我们找不着呢？难道他要往散住希利尼中的犹太人那里去教训希利尼人吗？</blockquote><p>约7:36<blockquote><p>What did he mean when he said, ‘You will look for me, but you will not find me,’ and’Where I am, you cannot come’?”<p>他说‘你们要找我，却找不着；我所在的地方，你们不能到’，这话是什么意思呢？”</blockquote><p>约7:37<blockquote><p>On the last and greatest day of the Feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.<p>节期的末日，就是最大之日，耶稣站着高声说：“人若渴了，可以到我这里来喝！</blockquote><p>约7:38<blockquote><p>Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him.”<p>信我的人，就如经上所说：‘从他腹中要流出活水的江河来。’”</blockquote><p>约7:39<blockquote><p>By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.<p>耶稣这话是指着信他之人要受圣灵说的。那时还没有赐下圣灵来，因为耶稣尚未得着荣耀。</blockquote><p>约7:40<blockquote><p>On hearing his words, some of the people said, “Surely this man is the Prophet.”<p>众人听见这话，有的说：“这真是那先知。”</blockquote><p>约7:41<blockquote><p>Others said, “He is the Christ.” Still others asked, “How can the Christ come from Galilee?<p>有的说：“这是基督。”但也有的说：“基督岂是从加利利出来的吗？</blockquote><p>约7:42<blockquote><p>Does not the Scripture say that the Christ will come from David’s family and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?”<p>经上岂不是说‘基督是大卫的后裔，从大卫本乡伯利恒出来的’吗？”</blockquote><p>约7:43<blockquote><p>Thus the people were divided because of Jesus.<p>于是众人因着耶稣起了纷争。</blockquote><p>约7:44<blockquote><p>Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him.<p>其中有人要捉拿他，只是无人下手。</blockquote><p>约7:45<blockquote><p>Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, “Why didn’t you bring him in?”<p>差役回到祭司长和法利赛人那里，他们对差役说：“你们为什么没有带他来呢？”</blockquote><p>约7:46<blockquote><p>“No one ever spoke the way this man does,” the guards declared.<p>差役回答说：“从来没有像他这样说话的。”</blockquote><p>约7:47<blockquote><p>“You mean he has deceived you also?” the Pharisees retorted.<p>法利赛人说：“你们也受了迷惑吗？</blockquote><p>约7:48<blockquote><p>“Has any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?<p>官长或是法利赛人岂有信他的呢？</blockquote><p>约7:49<blockquote><p>No! But this mob that knows nothing of the law–there is a curse on them.”<p>但这些不明白律法的百姓是被咒诅的。”</blockquote><p>约7:50<blockquote><p>Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked,<p>内中有尼哥底母，就是从前去见耶稣的，对他们说：</blockquote><p>约7:51<blockquote><p>“Does our law condemn anyone without first hearing him to find out what he is doing?”<p>“不先听本人的口供，不知道他所做的事，难道我们的律法还定他的罪吗？”</blockquote><p>约7:52<blockquote><p>They replied, “Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee.” The earliest and most reliable manuscripts and other ancient witnesses do not have John 7:53-8:11.7:53 Then each went to his own home.<p>他们回答说：“你也是出于加利利吗？你且去查考，就可知道加利利没有出过先知。”</blockquote><h2 id="约翰福音第8章">约翰福音第8章</h2><p>约8:1<blockquote><p>But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.<p>于是各人都回家去了，耶稣却往橄榄山去。</blockquote><p>约8:2<blockquote><p>At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them.<p>清早又回到殿里，众百姓都到他那里去，他就坐下教训他们。</blockquote><p>约8:3<blockquote><p>The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group<p>文士和法利赛人带着一个行淫时被拿的妇人来，叫她站在当中。</blockquote><p>约8:4<blockquote><p>and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.<p>就对耶稣说：“夫子，这妇人是正行淫之时被拿的。</blockquote><p>约8:5<blockquote><p>In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?”<p>摩西在律法上吩咐我们，把这样的妇人用石头打死。你说该把她怎么样呢？”</blockquote><p>约8:6<blockquote><p>They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger.<p>他们说这话，乃试探耶稣，要得着告他的把柄。耶稣却弯着腰用指头在地上画字。</blockquote><p>约8:7<blockquote><p>When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.”<p>他们还是不住地问他，耶稣就直起腰来，对他们说：“你们中间谁是没有罪的，谁就可以先拿石头打她。”</blockquote><p>约8:8<blockquote><p>Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.<p>于是又弯着腰用指头在地上画字。</blockquote><p>约8:9<blockquote><p>At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there.<p>他们听见这话，就从老到少一个一个地都出去了，只剩下耶稣一人，还有那妇人仍然站在当中。</blockquote><p>约8:10<blockquote><p>Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”<p>耶稣就直起腰来，对她说：“妇人，那些人在哪里呢？没有人定你的罪吗？”</blockquote><p>约8:11<blockquote><p>“No one, sir,” she said. “Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Go now and leave your life of sin.”<p>她说：“主啊，没有。”耶稣说：“我也不定你的罪，去吧！从此不要再犯罪了。”</blockquote><p>约8:12<blockquote><p>When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”<p>耶稣又对众人说：“我是世界的光。跟从我的，就不在黑暗里走，必要得着生命的光。”</blockquote><p>约8:13<blockquote><p>The Pharisees challenged him, “Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid.”<p>法利赛人对他说：“你是为自己作见证，你的见证不真。”</blockquote><p>约8:14<blockquote><p>Jesus answered, “Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going.<p>耶稣说：“我虽然为自己作见证，我的见证还是真的。因我知道我从哪里来，往哪里去；你们却不知道我从哪里来，往哪里去。</blockquote><p>约8:15<blockquote><p>You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one.<p>你们是以外貌（原文作“凭肉身”）判断人，我却不判断人。</blockquote><p>约8:16<blockquote><p>But if I do judge, my decisions are right, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me.<p>就是判断人，我的判断也是真的，因为不是我独自在这里，还有差我来的父与我同在。</blockquote><p>约8:17<blockquote><p>In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid.<p>你们的律法上也记着说：‘两个人的见证是真的。’</blockquote><p>约8:18<blockquote><p>I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me.”<p>我是为自己作见证，还有差我来的父也是为我作见证。”</blockquote><p>约8:19<blockquote><p>Then they asked him, “Where is your father?” “You do not know me or my Father,” Jesus replied. “If you knew me, you would know my Father also.”<p>他们就问他说：“你的父在哪里？”耶稣回答说：“你们不认识我，也不认识我的父；若是认识我，也就认识我的父。”</blockquote><p>约8:20<blockquote><p>He spoke these words while teaching in the temple area near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his time had not yet come.<p>这些话是耶稣在殿里的库房教训人时所说的，也没有人拿他，因为他的时候还没有到。</blockquote><p>约8:21<blockquote><p>Once more Jesus said to them, “I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come.”<p>耶稣又对他们说：“我要去了，你们要找我，并且你们要死在罪中；我所去的地方，你们不能到。”</blockquote><p>约8:22<blockquote><p>This made the Jews ask, “Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, ‘Where I go, you cannot come’?”<p>犹太人说：“他说‘我所去的地方，你们不能到’，难道他要自尽吗？”</blockquote><p>约8:23<blockquote><p>But he continued, “You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.<p>耶稣对他们说：“你们是从下头来的，我是从上头来的；你们是属这世界的，我不是属这世界的。</blockquote><p>约8:24<blockquote><p>I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am the one I claim to be, you will indeed die in your sins.”<p>所以我对你们说，你们要死在罪中；你们若不信我是基督，必要死在罪中。”</blockquote><p>约8:25<blockquote><p>“Who are you?” they asked. “Just what I have been claiming all along,” Jesus replied.<p>他们就问他说：“你是谁？”耶稣对他们说：“就是我从起初所告诉你们的。</blockquote><p>约8:26<blockquote><p>“I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is reliable, and what I have heard from him I tell the world.”<p>我有许多事讲论你们，判断你们；但那差我来的是真的，我在他那里所听见的，我就传给世人。”</blockquote><p>约8:27<blockquote><p>They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.<p>他们不明白耶稣是指着父说的。</blockquote><p>约8:28<blockquote><p>So Jesus said, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am the one I claim to be and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.<p>所以耶稣说：“你们举起人子以后，必知道我是基督，并且知道我没有一件事是凭着自己做的。我说这些话，乃是照着父所教训我的。</blockquote><p>约8:29<blockquote><p>The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him.”<p>那差我来的，是与我同在；他没有撇下我独自在这里，因为我常做他所喜悦的事。”</blockquote><p>约8:30<blockquote><p>Even as he spoke, many put their faith in him.<p>耶稣说这话的时候，就有许多人信他。</blockquote><p>约8:31<blockquote><p>To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.<p>耶稣对信他的犹太人说：“你们若常常遵守我的道，就真是我的门徒。</blockquote><p>约8:32<blockquote><p>Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”<p>你们必晓得真理，真理必叫你们得以自由。”</blockquote><p>约8:33<blockquote><p>They answered him, “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?”<p>他们回答说：“我们是亚伯拉罕的后裔，从来没有作过谁的奴仆，你怎么说‘你们必得以自由’呢？”</blockquote><p>约8:34<blockquote><p>Jesus replied, “I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.<p>耶稣回答说：“我实实在在地告诉你们：所有犯罪的，就是罪的奴仆。</blockquote><p>约8:35<blockquote><p>Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever.<p>奴仆不能永远住在家里，儿子是永远住在家鶪。</blockquote><p>约8:36<blockquote><p>So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.<p>所以天父的儿子若叫你们自由，你们就真自由了。</blockquote><p>约8:37<blockquote><p>I know you are Abraham’s descendants. Yet you are ready to kill me, because you have no room for my word.<p>我知道你们是亚伯拉罕的子孙，你们却想要杀我，因为你们心里容不下我的道。</blockquote><p>约8:38<blockquote><p>I am telling you what I have seen in the Father’s presence, and you do what you have heard from your father.”<p>我所说的，是在我父那里看见的；你们所行的，是在你们的父那里听见的。”</blockquote><p>约8:39<blockquote><p>“Abraham is our father,” they answered. “If you were Abraham’s children,” said Jesus, “then you would do the things Abraham did.<p>他们说：“我们的父就是亚伯拉罕。”耶稣说：“你们若是亚伯拉罕的儿子，就必行亚伯拉罕所行的事。</blockquote><p>约8:40<blockquote><p>As it is, you are determined to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.<p>我将在　神那里所听见的真理告诉了你们，现在你们却想要杀我！这不是亚伯拉罕所行的事，</blockquote><p>约8:41<blockquote><p>You are doing the things your own father does.” “We are not illegitimate children,” they protested. “The only Father we have is God himself.”<p>你们是行你们父所行的事。”他们说：“我们不是从淫乱生的，我们只有一位父，就是　神。”</blockquote><p>约8:42<blockquote><p>Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my own; but he sent me.<p>耶稣说：“倘若　神是你们的父，你们就必爱我，因为我本是出于　神，也是从　神而来，并不是由着自己来，乃是他差我来。</blockquote><p>约8:43<blockquote><p>Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.<p>你们为什么不明白我的话呢？无非是因你们不能听我的道。</blockquote><p>约8:44<blockquote><p>You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.<p>你们是出于你们的父魔鬼，你们父的私欲，你们偏要行。他从起初是杀人的，不守真理，因他心里没有真理；他说谎是出于自己，因他本来是说谎的，也是说谎之人的父。</blockquote><p>约8:45<blockquote><p>Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!<p>我将真理告诉你们，你们就因此不信我。</blockquote><p>约8:46<blockquote><p>Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don’t you believe me?<p>你们中间谁能指证我有罪呢？我既然将真理告诉你们，为什么不信我呢？</blockquote><p>约8:47<blockquote><p>He who belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.”<p>出于　神的，必听　神的话；你们不听，因为你们不是出于　神。”</blockquote><p>约8:48<blockquote><p>The Jews answered him, “Aren’t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?”<p>犹太人回答说：“我们说你是撒马利亚人，并且是鬼附着的，这话岂不正对吗？”</blockquote><p>约8:49<blockquote><p>“I am not possessed by a demon,” said Jesus, “but I honor my Father and you dishonor me.<p>耶稣说：“我不是鬼附着的，我尊敬我的父，你们倒轻慢我。</blockquote><p>约8:50<blockquote><p>I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.<p>我不求自己的荣耀，有一位为我求荣耀、定是非的。</blockquote><p>约8:51<blockquote><p>I tell you the truth, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.”<p>我实实在在地告诉你们：人若遵守我的道，就永远不见死。”</blockquote><p>约8:52<blockquote><p>At this the Jews exclaimed, “Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that if anyone keeps your word, he will never taste death.<p>犹太人对他说：“现在我们知道你是鬼附着的。亚伯拉罕死了，众先知也死了，你还说‘人若遵守我的道，就永远不尝死味’。</blockquote><p>约8:53<blockquote><p>Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?”<p>难道你比我们的祖宗亚伯拉罕还大吗？他死了，众先知也死了！你将自己当作什么人呢？”</blockquote><p>约8:54<blockquote><p>Jesus replied, “If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.<p>耶稣回答说：“我若荣耀自己，我的荣耀就算不得什么；荣耀我的乃是我的父，就是你们所说是你们的　神。</blockquote><p>约8:55<blockquote><p>Though you do not know him, I know him.

But now my kingdom is from another place.”<p>耶稣回答说：“我的国不属这世界。我的国若属这世界，我的臣仆必要争战，使我不至于被交给犹太人；只是我的国不属这世界。”</blockquote><p>约18:37<blockquote><p>“You are a king, then!” said Pilate. Jesus answered, “You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.”<p>彼拉多就对他说：“这样，你是王吗？”耶稣回答说：“你说我是王，我为此而生，也为此来到世间，特为给真理作见证。凡属真理的人就听我的话。”</blockquote><p>约18:38<blockquote><p>“What is truth?” Pilate asked. With this he went out again to the Jews and said, “I find no basis for a charge against him.<p>彼拉多说：“真理是什么呢？”说了这话，又出来到犹太人那里，对他们说：“我查不出他有什么罪来，</blockquote><p>约18:39<blockquote><p>But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release ‘the king of the Jews’?”<p>但你们有个规矩，在逾越节要我给你们释放一个人，你们要我给你们释放犹太人的王吗？”</blockquote><p>约18:40<blockquote><p>They shouted back, “No, not him! Give us Barabbas!” Now Barabbas had taken part in a rebellion.<p>他们又喊着说：“不要这人，要巴拉巴！”这巴拉巴是个强盗。</blockquote><h2 id="约翰福音第19章">约翰福音第19章</h2><p>约19:1<blockquote><p>Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.<p>当下彼拉多将耶稣鞭打了。</blockquote><p>约19:2<blockquote><p>The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe<p>兵丁用荆棘编作冠冕戴在他头上，给他穿上紫袍，</blockquote><p>约19:3<blockquote><p>and went up to him again and again, saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!” And they struck him in the face.<p>又挨近他说：“恭喜犹太人的王啊！”他们就用手掌打他。</blockquote><p>约19:4<blockquote><p>Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews, “Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.”<p>彼拉多又出来对众人说：“我带他出来见你们，叫你们知道我查不出他有什么罪来。”</blockquote><p>约19:5<blockquote><p>When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”<p>耶稣出来，戴着荆棘冠冕，穿着紫袍。彼拉多对他们说：“你们看这个人！”</blockquote><p>约19:6<blockquote><p>As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, “Crucify! Crucify!” But Pilate answered, “You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.”<p>祭司长和差役看见他，就喊着说：“钉他十字架！钉他十字架！”彼拉多说：“你们自己把他钉十字架吧！我查不出他有什么罪来。”</blockquote><p>约19:7<blockquote><p>The Jews insisted, “We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.”<p>犹太人回答说：“我们有律法，按那律法，他是该死的！因他以自己为　神的儿子。”</blockquote><p>约19:8<blockquote><p>When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid,<p>彼拉多听见这话，越发害怕。</blockquote><p>约19:9<blockquote><p>and he went back inside the palace. “Where do you come from?” he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer.<p>又进衙门，对耶稣说：“你是哪里来的？”耶稣却不回答。</blockquote><p>约19:10<blockquote><p>“Do you refuse to speak to me?” Pilate said. “Don’t you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?”<p>彼拉多说：“你不对我说话吗？你岂不知我有权柄释放你，也有权柄把你钉十字架吗？”</blockquote><p>约19:11<blockquote><p>Jesus answered, “You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.”<p>耶稣回答说：“若不是从上头赐给你的，你就毫无权柄办我，所以把我交给你的那人，罪更重了。”</blockquote><p>约19:12<blockquote><p>From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jews kept shouting, “If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar.”<p>从此彼拉多想要释放耶稣，无奈犹太人喊着说：“你若释放这个人，就不是凯撒的忠臣（原文作“朋友”）。凡以自己为王的，就是背叛凯撒了。”</blockquote><p>约19:13<blockquote><p>When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge’s seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha).<p>彼拉多听见这话，就带耶稣出来，到了一个地方，名叫铺华石处，希伯来话叫厄巴大，就在那里坐堂。</blockquote><p>约19:14<blockquote><p>It was the day of Preparation of Passover Week, about the sixth hour. “Here is your king,” Pilate said to the Jews.<p>那日是预备逾越节的日子。约有午正，彼拉多对犹太人说：“看哪，这是你们的王！”</blockquote><p>约19:15<blockquote><p>But they shouted, “Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!” “Shall I crucify your king?” Pilate asked. “We have no king but Caesar,” the chief priests answered.<p>他们喊着说：“除掉他！除掉他！钉他在十字架上！”彼拉多说：“我可以把你们的王钉十字架吗？”祭司长回答说：“除了凯撒，我们没有王！”</blockquote><p>约19:16<blockquote><p>Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. So the soldiers took charge of Jesus.<p>于是，彼拉多将耶稣交给他们去钉十字架。</blockquote><p>约19:17<blockquote><p>Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha).<p>他们就把耶稣带了去。耶稣背着自己的十字架出来，到了一个地方，名叫髑髅地，希伯来话叫各各他。</blockquote><p>约19:18<blockquote><p>Here they crucified him, and with him two others–one on each side and Jesus in the middle.<p>他们就在那里钉他在十字架上，还有两个人和他一同钉着，一边一个，耶稣在中间。</blockquote><p>约19:19<blockquote><p>Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.<p>彼拉多又用牌子写了一个名号，安在十字架上，写的是：“犹太人的王，拿撒勒人耶稣。”</blockquote><p>约19:20<blockquote><p>Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek.<p>有许多犹太人念这名号，因为耶稣被钉十字架的地方，与城相近，并且是用希伯来、罗马、希利尼三样文字写的。</blockquote><p>约19:21<blockquote><p>The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The King of the Jews,’ but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews.”<p>犹太人的祭司长就对彼拉多说：“不要写‘犹太人的王’，要写‘他自己说我是犹太人的王’。”</blockquote><p>约19:22<blockquote><p>Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”<p>彼拉多说：“我所写的，我已经写上了。”</blockquote><p>约19:23<blockquote><p>When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.<p>兵丁既然将耶稣钉在十字架上，就拿他的衣服分为四份，每兵一份；又拿他的里衣，这件里衣原来没有缝儿，是上下一片织成的。</blockquote><p>约19:24<blockquote><p>“Let’s not tear it,” they said to one another. “Let’s decide by lot who will get it.” This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled which said, “They divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.” So this is what the soldiers did.<p>他们就彼此说：“我们不要撕开，只要拈阄，看谁得着。”这要应验经上的话说：“他们分了我的外衣，为我的里衣拈阄。”兵丁果然做了这事。</blockquote><p>约19:25<blockquote><p>Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.<p>站在耶稣十字架旁边的，有他母亲与他母亲的姊妹，并革罗罢的妻子马利亚和抹大拉的马利亚。</blockquote><p>约19:26<blockquote><p>When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, “Dear woman, here is your son,”<p>耶稣见母亲和他所爱的那门徒站在旁边，就对他母亲说：“母亲（原文作“妇人”），看，你的儿子！”</blockquote><p>约19:27<blockquote><p>and to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.<p>又对那门徒说：“看，你的母亲！”从此那门徒就接她到自己家里去了。</blockquote><p>约19:28<blockquote><p>Later, knowing that all was now completed, and so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, “I am thirsty.”<p>这事以后，耶稣知道各样的事已经成了，为要使经上的话应验，就说：“我渴了。”</blockquote><p>约19:29<blockquote><p>A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus’ lips.<p>有一个器皿盛满了醋，放在那里，他们就拿海绒蘸满了醋，绑在牛膝草上，送到他口。</blockquote><p>约19:30<blockquote><p>When he had received the drink, Jesus said, “It is finished.” With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.<p>耶稣尝（原文作“受”）了那醋，就说：“成了！”，便低下头，将灵魂交付　神了。</blockquote><p>约19:31<blockquote><p>Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.<p>犹太人因这日是预备日，又因那安息日是个大日，就求彼拉多叫人打断他们的腿，把他们拿去，免得尸首当安息日留在十字架上。</blockquote><p>约19:32<blockquote><p>The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other.<p>于是兵丁来，把头一个人的腿，并与耶稣同钉第二个人的腿都打断了。</blockquote><p>约19:33<blockquote><p>But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.<p>只是来到耶稣那里，见他已经死了，就不打断他的腿。</blockquote><p>约19:34<blockquote><p>Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus’ side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water.<p>惟有一个兵拿枪扎他的肋旁，随即有血和水流出来。</blockquote><p>约19:35<blockquote><p>The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.<p>看见这事的那人就作见证，他的见证也是真的，并且他知道自己所说的是真的，叫你们也可以信。</blockquote><p>约19:36<blockquote><p>These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: “Not one of his bones will be broken,”<p>这些事成了，为要应验经上的话说：“他的骨头一根也不可折断。”</blockquote><p>约19:37<blockquote><p>and, as another scripture says, “They will look on the one they have pierced.”<p>经上又有一句说：“他们要仰望自己所扎的人。”</blockquote><p>约19:38<blockquote><p>Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jews. With Pilate’s permission, he came and took the body away.<p>这些事以后，有亚利马太人约瑟，是耶稣的门徒，只因怕犹太人，就暗暗地作门徒。他来求彼拉多，要把耶稣的身体领去。彼拉多允准，他就把耶稣的身体领去了。</blockquote><p>约19:39<blockquote><p>He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds.<p>又有尼哥底母，就是先前夜里去见耶稣的，带着没药和沉香约有一百斤前来。</blockquote><p>约19:40<blockquote><p>Taking Jesus’ body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs.<p>他们就照犹太人殡葬的规矩，把耶稣的身体用细麻布加上香料裹好了。</blockquote><p>约19:41<blockquote><p>At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid.<p>在耶稣钉十字架的地方有一个园子，园子里有一座新坟墓，是从来没有葬过人的。</blockquote><p>约19:42<blockquote><p>Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.<p>只因是犹太人的预备日，又因那坟墓近，他们就把耶稣安放在那里。</blockquote><h2 id="约翰福音第20章">约翰福音第20章</h2><p>约20:1<blockquote><p>Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.<p>七日的第一日清早，天还黑的时候，抹大拉的马利亚来到坟墓那里，看见石头从坟墓挪开了，</blockquote><p>约20:2<blockquote><p>So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don’t know where they have put him!”<p>就跑来见西门彼得和耶稣所爱的那个门徒，对他们说：“有人把主从坟墓里挪了去，我们不知道放在哪鶪！”</blockquote><p>约20:3<blockquote><p>So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.<p>彼得和那门徒就出来，往坟墓那里去。</blockquote><p>约20:4<blockquote><p>Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.<p>两个人同跑，那门徒比彼得跑得更快，先到了坟墓，</blockquote><p>约20:5<blockquote><p>He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in.<p>低头往里看，就见细麻布还放在那鶪，只是没有进去。</blockquote><p>约20:6<blockquote><p>Then Simon Peter, who was behind him, arrived and went into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there,<p>西门彼得随后也到了，进坟墓里去，就看见细麻布还放在那鶪，</blockquote><p>约20:7<blockquote><p>as well as the burial cloth that had been around Jesus’ head. The cloth was folded up by itself, separate from the linen.<p>又看见耶稣的裹头巾没有和细麻布放在一处，是另在一处卷着。</blockquote><p>约20:8<blockquote><p>Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed.<p>先到坟墓的那门徒也进去，看见就信了。</blockquote><p>约20:9<blockquote><p>(They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.)<p>因为他们还不明白圣经的意思，就是耶稣必要从死里复活。</blockquote><p>约20:10<blockquote><p>Then the disciples went back to their homes,<p>于是两个门徒回自己的住处去了。</blockquote><p>约20:11<blockquote><p>but Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb<p>马利亚却站在坟墓外面哭，哭的时候，低头往坟墓里看，</blockquote><p>约20:12<blockquote><p>and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus’ body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.<p>就见两个天使，穿着白衣，在安放耶稣身体的地方坐着，一个在头，一个在脚。</blockquote><p>约20:13<blockquote><p>They asked her, “Woman, why are you crying?” “They have taken my Lord away,” she said, “and I don’t know where they have put him.”<p>天使对她说：“妇人，你为什么哭？”她说：“因为有人把我主挪了去，我不知道放在哪里。”</blockquote><p>约20:14<blockquote><p>At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus.<p>说了这话，就转过身来，看见耶稣站在那里，却不知道是耶稣。</blockquote><p>约20:15<blockquote><p>“Woman,” he said, “why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?” Thinking he was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him.”<p>耶稣问她说：“妇人，为什么哭？你找谁呢？”马利亚以为是看园的，就对他说：“先生，若是你把他移了去，请告诉我你把他放在哪里，我便去取他。”</blockquote><p>约20:16<blockquote><p>Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, “Rabboni!” (which means Teacher).<p>耶稣说：“马利亚！”马利亚就转过来，用希伯来话对他说：“拉波尼（拉波尼就是夫子的意思）！”</blockquote><p>约20:17<blockquote><p>Jesus said, “Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”<p>耶稣说：“不要摸我，因我还没有升上去见我的父。你往我弟兄那里去，告诉他们说：我要升上去见我的父，也是你们的父；见我的　神，也是你们的　神。”</blockquote><p>约20:18<blockquote><p>Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them that he had said these things to her.<p>抹大拉的马利亚就去告诉门徒说：“我已经看见了主！”她又将主对她说的这话告诉他们。</blockquote><p>约20:19<blockquote><p>On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!”<p>那日（就是七日的第一日）晚上，门徒所在的地方，因怕犹太人，门都关了。耶稣来站在当中，对他们说：“愿你们平安！”</blockquote><p>约20:20<blockquote><p>After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.<p>说了这话，就把手和肋旁指给他们看。门徒看见主，就喜乐了。</blockquote><p>约20:21<blockquote><p>Again Jesus said, “Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.”<p>耶稣又对他们说：“愿你们平安！父怎样差遣了我，我也照样差遣你们。”</blockquote><p>约20:22<blockquote><p>And with that he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit.<p>说了这话，就向他们吹一口气，说：“你们受圣灵。</blockquote><p>约20:23<blockquote><p>If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.”<p>你们赦免谁的罪，谁的罪就赦免了；你们留下谁的罪，谁的罪就留下了。”</blockquote><p>约20:24<blockquote><p>Now Thomas (called Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.<p>那十二个门徒中，有称为低土马的多马，耶稣来的时候，他没有和他们同在。</blockquote><p>约20:25<blockquote><p>So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it.”<p>那些门徒就对他说：“我们已经看见主了。”多马却说：“我非看见他手上的钉痕，用指头探入那钉痕，又用手探入他的肋旁，我总不信。”</blockquote><p>约20:26<blockquote><p>A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them.
