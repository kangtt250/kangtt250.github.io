>
> 这事做完了，众首领来见我说：“以色列民和祭司并利未人，没有离绝迦南人、赫人、比利洗人、耶布斯人、亚扪人、摩押人、埃及人、亚摩利人，仍效法这些国的民，行可憎的事。


拉9:2
> They have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, and have mingled the holy race with the peoples around them. And the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness."
>
> 因他们为自己和儿子娶了这些外邦女子为妻，以致圣洁的种类和这些国的民混杂，而且首领和官长在这事上为罪魁。”


拉9:3
> When I heard this, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled.
>
> 我一听见这事，就撕裂衣服和外袍，拔了头发和胡须，惊惧忧闷而坐。

>
> 献晚祭的时候，我起来，心中愁苦，穿着撕裂的衣袍，双膝跪下向耶和华我的　神举手，


拉9:6
> and prayed: "O my God, I am too ashamed and disgraced to lift up my face to you, my God, because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens.
>
> 说：“我的　神啊，我抱愧蒙羞，不敢向我　神仰面，因为我们的罪孽灭顶，我们的罪恶滔天。


拉9:7
> From the days of our forefathers until now, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings, as it is today.
>
> 从我们列祖直到今日，我们的罪恶甚重。因我们的罪孽，我们和君王、祭司都交在外邦列王的手中，杀害、掳掠、抢夺、脸上蒙羞，正如今日的光景。


拉9:8

>
> 现在耶和华我们的　神暂且施恩与我们，给我们留些逃脱的人，使我们安稳如钉子，钉在他的圣所，我们的　神好光照我们的眼目，使我们在受辖制之中稍微复兴。


拉9:9
> Though we are slaves, our God has not deserted us in our bondage. He has shown us kindness in the sight of the kings of Persia: He has granted us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins, and he has given us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem.
>
> 我们是奴仆，然而在受辖制之中，我们的　神仍没有丢弃我们，在波斯王眼前向我们施恩，叫我们复兴，能重建我们　神的殿，修其毁坏之处，使我们在犹大和耶路撒冷有墙垣。


拉9:10
> "But now, O our God, what can we say after this? For we have disregarded the commands
>
> 我们的　神啊，既是如此，我们还有什么话可说呢？因为我们已经离弃你的命令，


拉9:11
> you gave through your servants the prophets when you said: 'The land you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples. By their detestable practices they have filled it with their impurity from one end to the other.
>
> 就是你藉你仆人众先知所吩咐的说：‘你们要去得为业之地是污秽之地，因列国之民的污秽和可憎的事，叫全地从这边直到那边满了污秽。


拉9:12
> Therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them at any time, that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance.'
>
> 所以不可将你们的女儿嫁他们的儿子；也不可为你们的儿子娶他们的女儿。永不可求他们的平安和他们的利益，这样你们就可以强盛，吃这地的美物，并遗留这地给你们的子孙永远为业。’


拉9:13
> "What has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt, and yet, our God, you have punished us less than our sins have deserved and have given us a remnant like this.
>
> 神啊，我们因自己的恶行和大罪，遭遇了这一切的事，并且你刑罚我们轻于我们罪所当得的，又给我们留下这些人。


拉9:14
> Shall we again break your commands and intermarry with the peoples who commit such detestable practices? Would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us, leaving us no remnant or survivor?
>
> 我们岂可再违背你的命令，与这行可憎之事的民结亲呢？若这样行，你岂不向我们发怒，将我们灭绝，以致没有一个剩下逃脱的人吗？


拉9:15
> O LORD, God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence."
>
> 耶和华以色列的　神啊！因你是公义的，我们这剩下的人才得逃脱，正如今日的光景。看哪！我们在你面前有罪恶，因此无人在你面前站立得住。”

拉10:12
> The whole assembly responded with a loud voice: "You are right! We must do as you say.
>
> 会众都大声回答说：“我们必照着你的话行，


拉10:13
> But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing.
>
> 只是百姓众多，又逢大雨的时令，我们不能站在外头，这也不是一两天办完的事。因我们在这事上犯了大罪，


拉10:14
> Let our officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us."
>
> 不如为全会众派首领办理。凡我们城邑中娶外邦女子为妻的，当按所定的日期，同着本城的长老和士师而来，直到办完这事，　神的烈怒就转离我们了。”


拉10:15
> Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this.
