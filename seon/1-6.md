#  Build or Buy Equity in a Business

在企业中建立或购买股权

If you don’t own a piece of a business, you don’t have a path towards financial freedom.
如果你不拥有一家企业的一部分，你就没有一条通往财务自由的道路。

Why is owning equity in a business important to becoming rich?
为什么拥有一家企业的股权对致富很重要？

It’s ownership versus wage work. If you are paid for renting out your time, even lawyers and doctors, you can make some money, but you’re not going to make the money that gives you financial freedom. You’re not going to have passive income where a business is earning for you while you are on vacation. [10]

这是所有权与工资性工作的较量。如果你的时间是租出去的，即使是律师和医生，你也可以赚到一些钱，但你赚不到给你财务自由的钱。你不会有被动收入，因为在你度假期间，企业正在为你赚钱。“[10]
This is probably one of the most important points. People seem to think you can create wealth—make money through work. It’s probably not going to work. There are many reasons for that.
这可能是最重要的一点。人们似乎认为你可以创造财富--通过工作赚钱。这可能行不通。这其中有很多原因。

Without ownership, your inputs are very closely tied to your outputs. In almost any salaried job, even one paying a lot per hour like a lawyer or a doctor, you’re still putting in the hours, and every hour you get paid.

如果没有所有权，您的输入将与您的输出紧密地联系在一起。几乎在任何一份有工资的工作中，即使是像律师或医生这样的时薪很高的工作，你仍然在投入时间，而且每小时你都能拿到工资。

Without ownership, when you’re sleeping, you’re not earning. When you’re retired, you’re not earning. When you’re on vacation, you’re not earning. And you can’t earn nonlinearly.
如果没有所有权，当你睡觉的时候，你就赚不到钱。当你退休后，你就赚不到钱了。当你在度假的时候，你赚不到钱。而且你不能非线性地赚钱。

If you look at even doctors who get rich (like really rich), it’s because they open a business. They open a private practice. The private practice builds a brand, and the brand attracts people. Or they build some kind of a medical device, a procedure, or a process with an intellectual property.

如果你看看那些致富的医生(比如真的很有钱)，那是因为他们开了一家公司。他们开了一家私人诊所。私人执业打造品牌，品牌吸引人。或者他们制造某种具有知识产权的医疗设备、程序或过程。

Essentially, you’re working for somebody else, and that person is taking on the risk and has the accountability, the intellectual property, and the brand. They’re not going to pay you enough. They’re going to pay you the bare minimum they have to, to get you to do their job. That can be a high bare minimum, but it’s still not going to be true wealth where you’re retired but still earning. [78]

从本质上说，你是在为别人工作，而这个人正在承担风险，承担责任，拥有知识产权和品牌。他们不会付给你足够的钱。为了让你做他们的工作，他们会付给你最低工资。这可能是一个很高的最低限度，但在你退休但仍在赚钱的地方，这仍然不会是真正的财富。“[78]

Owning equity in a company basically means you own the upside. When you own debt, you own guaranteed revenue streams and you own the downside. You want to own equity. If you don’t own equity in a business, your odds of making money are very slim.

拥有一家公司的股权基本上意味着你拥有上行空间。当你拥有债务时，你就拥有了有保证的收入来源，你就拥有了下行空间。你想拥有股权。如果你不拥有一家企业的股权，你赚钱的机会就非常渺茫。

You have to work up to the point where you can own equity in a business. You could own equity as a small shareholder where you bought stock. You could also own it as an owner where you started the company. Ownership is really important. [10]

你必须努力工作，直到你可以拥有一家企业的股权。你可以作为小股东持有股权，在那里你购买了股票。你也可以作为你创办公司的所有者拥有它。所有权真的很重要。“[10]

Everybody who really makes money at some point owns a piece of a product, a business, or some IP. That can be through stock options if you work at a tech company. That’s a fine way to start.
每个在某个时候真正赚钱的人都拥有一件产品、一家企业或一些知识产权。如果你在一家科技公司工作，那可以通过股票期权来实现。这是一个很好的开始方式。

But usually, the real wealth is created by starting your own companies or even by investing. In an investment firm, they’re buying equity. These are the routes to wealth. It doesn’t come through the hours. [78]

但通常情况下，真正的财富是通过创办自己的公司，甚至是通过投资来创造的。在一家投资公司，他们在购买股权。这些都是致富之路。它不是通过时间来的。)[78]
