Listen, O earth! For the LORD has spoken: “I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me.<p>天哪，要听！地啊，侧耳而听！因为耶和华说：我养育儿女，将他们养大，他们竟悖逆我。</blockquote><p>赛1:3<blockquote><p>The ox knows his master, the donkey his owner’s manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand.”<p>牛认识主人，驴认识主人的槽；以色列却不认识，我的民却不留意。</blockquote><p>赛1:4<blockquote><p>Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with guilt, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him.<p>嗐！犯罪的国民，担着罪孽的百姓；行恶的种类，败坏的儿女！他们离弃耶和华，藐视以色列的圣者，与他生疏，往后退步。</blockquote><p>赛1:5<blockquote><p>Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted.<p>你们为什么屡次悖逆，还要受责打吗？你们已经满头疼痛，全心发昏。</blockquote><p>赛1:6<blockquote><p>From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness–only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil.<p>从脚掌到头顶，没有一处完全的，尽是伤口、青肿与新打的伤痕，都没有收口，没有缠裹，也没有用膏滋润。</blockquote><p>赛1:7<blockquote><p>Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers.<p>你们的地土已经荒凉，你们的城邑被火焚毁，你们的田地在你们眼前为外邦人所侵吞。既被外邦人倾覆，就成为荒凉。</blockquote><p>赛1:8<blockquote><p>The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege.<p>仅存锡安城（“城”原文作“女子”），好像葡萄园的草棚，瓜田的茅屋，被围困的城邑。</blockquote><p>赛1:9<blockquote><p>Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.<p>若不是万军之耶和华给我们稍留余种，我们早已像所多玛、蛾摩拉的样子了。</blockquote><p>赛1:10<blockquote><p>Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!<p>你们这所多玛的官长啊，要听耶和华的话！你们这蛾摩拉的百姓啊，要侧耳听我们　神的训诲！</blockquote><p>赛1:11<blockquote><p>“The multitude of your sacrifices–what are they to me?” says the LORD. “I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.<p>耶和华说：“你们所献的许多祭物与我何益呢？公绵羊的燔祭和肥畜的脂油，我已经够了；公牛的血，羊羔的血，公山羊的血，我都不喜悦。</blockquote><p>赛1:12<blockquote><p>When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts?<p>你们来朝见我，谁向你们讨这些，使你们践踏我的院宇呢？</blockquote><p>赛1:13<blockquote><p>Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations–I cannot bear your evil assemblies.<p>你们不要再献虚浮的供物。香品是我所憎恶的；月朔和安息日，并宣召的大会，也是我所憎恶的；作罪孽又守严肃会，我也不能容忍。</blockquote><p>赛1:14<blockquote><p>Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.<p>你们的月朔和节期，我心里恨恶，我都以为麻烦；我担当，便不耐烦。</blockquote><p>赛1:15<blockquote><p>When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you; even if you offer many prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood;<p>你们举手祷告，我必遮眼不看；就是你们多多地祈祷，我也不听。你们的手都满了杀人的血。</blockquote><p>赛1:16<blockquote><p>wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong,<p>你们要洗濯、自洁，从我眼前除掉你们的恶行；要止住作恶，</blockquote><p>赛1:17<blockquote><p>learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow.<p>学习行善，寻求公平，解救受欺压的，给孤儿伸冤，为寡妇辨屈。”</blockquote><p>赛1:18<blockquote><p>“Come now, let us reason together,” says the LORD. “Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.<p>耶和华说：“你们来，我们彼此辩论。你们的罪虽像朱红，必变成雪白；虽红如丹颜，必白如羊毛。</blockquote><p>赛1:19<blockquote><p>If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land;<p>你们若甘心听从，必吃地上的美物；</blockquote><p>赛1:20<blockquote><p>but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword.” For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.<p>若不听从，反倒悖逆，必被刀剑吞灭。”这是耶和华亲口说的。</blockquote><p>赛1:21<blockquote><p>See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her–but now murderers!<p>可叹，忠信的城变为妓女！从前充满了公平，公义居在其中，现今却有凶手居住。</blockquote><p>赛1:22<blockquote><p>Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water.<p>你的银子变为渣滓；你的酒用水搀对。</blockquote><p>赛1:23<blockquote><p>Your rulers are rebels, companions of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow’s case does not come before them.<p>你的官长居心悖逆，与盗贼作伴，各都喜爱贿赂，追求赃私。他们不为孤儿伸冤，寡妇的案件也不得呈到他们面前。</blockquote><p>赛1:24<blockquote><p>Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: “Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies.<p>因此，主万军之耶和华以色列的大能者说：“哎！我要向我的对头雪恨，向我的敌人报仇。</blockquote><p>赛1:25<blockquote><p>I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities.<p>我必反手加在你身上，炼尽你的渣滓，除净你的杂质。</blockquote><p>赛1:26<blockquote><p>I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.”<p>我也必复还你的审判官，像起初一样；复还你的谋士，像起先一般。然后，你必称为公义之城、忠信之邑。”</blockquote><p>赛1:27<blockquote><p>Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness.<p>锡安必因公平得蒙救赎，其中归正的人必因公义得蒙救赎。</blockquote><p>赛1:28<blockquote><p>But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish.<p>但悖逆的和犯罪的必一同败亡；离弃耶和华的必致消灭。</blockquote><p>赛1:29<blockquote><p>“You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen.<p>那等人必因你们所喜爱的橡树抱愧，你们必因所选择的园子蒙羞。</blockquote><p>赛1:30<blockquote><p>You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water.<p>因为你们必如叶子枯干的橡树，好像无水浇灌的园子。</blockquote><p>赛1:31<blockquote><p>The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire.”<p>有权势的必如麻瓤，他的工作好像火星，都要一同焚毁，无人扑灭。</blockquote><h2 id="以赛亚书第2章">以赛亚书第2章</h2><p>赛2:1<blockquote><p>This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:<p>亚摩斯的儿子以赛亚得默示，论到犹大和耶路撒冷：</blockquote><p>赛2:2<blockquote><p>In the last days the mountain of the LORD’S temple will be established as chief among the mountains; it will be raised above the hills, and all nations will stream to it.<p>末后的日子，耶和华殿的山必坚立，超乎诸山，高举过于万岭，万民都要流归这山。</blockquote><p>赛2:3<blockquote><p>Many peoples will come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths.” The law will go out from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.<p>必有许多国的民前往说：“来吧！我们登耶和华的山，奔雅各　神的殿；主必将他的道教训我们，我们也要行他的路。因为训诲必出于锡安；耶和华的言语必出于耶路撒冷。”</blockquote><p>赛2:4<blockquote><p>He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.<p>他必在列国中施行审判，为许多国民断定是非。他们要将刀打成犁头，把枪打成镰刀；这国不举刀攻击那国，他们也不再学习战事。</blockquote><p>赛2:5<blockquote><p>Come, O house of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the LORD.<p>雅各家啊，来吧！我们在耶和华的光明中行走。</blockquote><p>赛2:6<blockquote><p>You have abandoned your people, the house of Jacob. They are full of superstitions from the East; they practice divination like the Philistines and clasp hands with pagans.<p>耶和华，你离弃了你百姓雅各家，是因他们充满了东方的风俗，作观兆的，像非利士人一样，并与外邦人击掌。</blockquote><p>赛2:7<blockquote><p>Their land is full of silver and gold; there is no end to their treasures. Their land is full of horses; there is no end to their chariots.<p>他们的国满了金银，财宝也无穷；他们的地满了马匹，车辆也无数。</blockquote><p>赛2:8<blockquote><p>Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their fingers have made.<p>他们的地满了偶像，他们跪拜自己手所造的，就是自己指头所做的。</blockquote><p>赛2:9<blockquote><p>So man will be brought low and mankind humbled–do not forgive them.<p>卑贱人屈膝，尊贵人下跪，所以不可饶恕他们。</blockquote><p>赛2:10<blockquote><p>Go into the rocks, hide in the ground from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty!<p>你当进入岩穴，藏在土中，躲避耶和华的惊吓和他威严的荣光。</blockquote><p>赛2:11<blockquote><p>The eyes of the arrogant man will be humbled and the pride of men brought low; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.<p>到那日，眼目高傲的必降为卑，性情狂傲的都必屈膝，惟独耶和华被尊崇。</blockquote><p>赛2:12<blockquote><p>The LORD Almighty has a day in store for all the proud and lofty, for all that is exalted (and they will be humbled),<p>必有万军耶和华降罚的一个日子，要临到骄傲狂妄的，一切自高的都必降为卑；</blockquote><p>赛2:13<blockquote><p>for all the cedars of Lebanon, tall and lofty, and all the oaks of Bashan,<p>又临到黎巴嫩高大的香柏树和巴珊的橡树；</blockquote><p>赛2:14<blockquote><p>for all the towering mountains and all the high hills,<p>又临到一切高山的峻岭；</blockquote><p>赛2:15<blockquote><p>for every lofty tower and every fortified wall,<p>又临到高台和坚固城墙；</blockquote><p>赛2:16<blockquote><p>for every trading ship and every stately vessel.<p>又临到他施的船只并一切可爱的美物。</blockquote><p>赛2:17<blockquote><p>The arrogance of man will be brought low and the pride of men humbled; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day,<p>骄傲的必屈膝，狂妄的必降卑；在那日，惟独耶和华被尊崇。</blockquote><p>赛2:18<blockquote><p>and the idols will totally disappear.<p>偶像必全然废弃。</blockquote><p>赛2:19<blockquote><p>Men will flee to caves in the rocks and to holes in the ground from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.<p>耶和华兴起使地大震动的时候，人就进入石洞，进入土穴，躲避耶和华的惊吓和他威严的荣光。</blockquote><p>赛2:20<blockquote><p>In that day men will throw away to the rodents and bats their idols of silver and idols of gold, which they made to worship.<p>到那日，人必将为拜而造的金偶像、银偶像抛给田鼠和蝙蝠。</blockquote><p>赛2:21<blockquote><p>They will flee to caverns in the rocks and to the overhanging crags from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.<p>到耶和华兴起使地大震动的时候，人好进入磐石洞中和岩石穴里，躲避耶和华的惊吓和他威严的荣光。</blockquote><p>赛2:22<blockquote><p>Stop trusting in man, who has but a breath in his nostrils.

Yet no sooner is Zion in labor than she gives birth to her children.<p>国岂能一日而生？民岂能一时而产？因为锡安一劬劳，便生下儿女。这样的事谁曾听见、谁曾看见呢？”</blockquote><p>赛66:9<blockquote><p>Do I bring to the moment of birth and not give delivery?” says the LORD. “Do I close up the womb when I bring to delivery?” says your God.<p>耶和华说：“我既使她临产，岂不使她生产呢？”你的　神说：“我既使她生产，岂能使她闭胎不生呢？</blockquote><p>赛66:10<blockquote><p>“Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all you who love her; rejoice greatly with her, all you who mourn over her.<p>你们爱慕耶路撒冷的，都要与她一同欢喜快乐；你们为她悲哀的，都要与她一同乐上加乐；</blockquote><p>赛66:11<blockquote><p>For you will nurse and be satisfied at her comforting breasts; you will drink deeply and delight in her overflowing abundance.”<p>使你们在她安慰的怀中吃奶得饱，使他们得她丰盛的荣耀，犹如挤奶，满心喜乐。”</blockquote><p>赛66:12<blockquote><p>For this is what the LORD says: “I will extend peace to her like a river, and the wealth of nations like a flooding stream; you will nurse and be carried on her arm and dandled on her knees.<p>耶和华如此说：“我要使平安延及她，好像江河；使列国的荣耀延及她，如同涨溢的河。你们要从中享受（原文作“咂”），你们必蒙抱在肋旁，摇弄在膝上。</blockquote><p>赛66:13<blockquote><p>As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you; and you will be comforted over Jerusalem.”<p>母亲怎样安慰儿子，我就照样安慰你们。你们也必因（或作“在”）耶路撒冷得安慰。”</blockquote><p>赛66:14<blockquote><p>When you see this, your heart will rejoice and you will flourish like grass; the hand of the LORD will be made known to his servants, but his fury will be shown to his foes.<p>你们看见，就心中快乐，你们的骨头必得滋润，像嫩草一样。而且耶和华的手向他仆人所行的，必被人知道；他也要向仇敌发恼恨。</blockquote><p>赛66:15<blockquote><p>See, the LORD is coming with fire, and his chariots are like a whirlwind; he will bring down his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.<p>“看哪，耶和华必在火中降临。他的车辇像旋风，以烈怒施行报应，以火焰施行责罚。</blockquote><p>赛66:16<blockquote><p>For with fire and with his sword the LORD will execute judgment upon all men, and many will be those slain by the LORD.<p>因为耶和华在一切有血气的人身上，必以火与刀施行审判，被耶和华所杀的必多。</blockquote><p>赛66:17<blockquote><p>“Those who consecrate and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following the one in the midst of those who eat the flesh of pigs and rats and other abominable things–they will meet their end together,” declares the LORD.<p>那些分别为圣、洁净自己的，进入园内。跟在其中一个人的后头吃猪肉和仓鼠，并可憎之物，他们必一同灭绝。”这是耶和华说的。</blockquote><p>赛66:18<blockquote><p>“And I, because of their actions and their imaginations, am about to come and gather all nations and tongues, and they will come and see my glory.<p>“我知道他们的行为和他们的意念。时候将到，我必将万民万族（“族”原文作“舌”）聚来，看见我的荣耀。</blockquote><p>赛66:19<blockquote><p>“I will set a sign among them, and I will send some of those who survive to the nations–to Tarshish, to the Libyans and Lydians (famous as archers), to Tubal and Greece, and to the distant islands that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory. They will proclaim my glory among the nations.<p>我要显神迹（或作“记号”）在他们中间，逃脱的我要差到列国去，就是到他施、普勒、拉弓的路德和土巴、雅完，并素来没有听见我名声、没有看见我荣耀辽远的海岛，他们必将我的荣耀传扬在列国中。</blockquote><p>赛66:20<blockquote><p>And they will bring all your brothers, from all the nations, to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the LORD–on horses, in chariots and wagons, and on mules and camels,” says the LORD. “They will bring them, as the Israelites bring their grain offerings, to the temple of the LORD in ceremonially clean vessels.<p>他们必将你们的弟兄从列国中送回，使他们或骑马，或坐车，坐轿，骑骡子，骑独峰驼，到我的圣山耶路撒冷，作为供物献给耶和华，好像以色列人用洁净的器皿盛供物奉到耶和华的殿中。”这是耶和华说的。</blockquote><p>赛66:21<blockquote><p>And I will select some of them also to be priests and Levites,” says the LORD.<p>耶和华说：“我也必从他们中间取人为祭司，为利未人。”</blockquote><p>赛66:22<blockquote><p>“As the new heavens and the new earth that I make will endure before me,” declares the LORD, “so will your name and descendants endure.<p>耶和华说：“我所要造的新天新地，怎样在我面前长存，你们的后裔和你们的名字也必照样长存！</blockquote><p>赛66:23<blockquote><p>From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me,” says the LORD.<p>每逢月朔、安息日，凡有血气的必来在我面前下拜。”这是耶和华说的。</blockquote><p>赛66:24<blockquote><p>“And they will go out and look upon the dead bodies of those who rebelled against me; their worm will not die, nor will their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind.”<p>“他们必出去观看那些违背我人的尸首，因为他们的虫是不死的，他们的火是不灭的。凡有血气的都必憎恶他们。”</blockquote></article><footer role="contentinfo"><hr/><p><small class="copyright">© Seon Zhu 2022.
