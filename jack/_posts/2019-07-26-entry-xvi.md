With a lot of us heading to and fro, visiting friends and relatives around this time, we felt that we should take a
break from Project V for a bit. After all, a bit of R&R can be vital to someone's productivity. 

To that end, we'll be taking this week and the next off. The next blog post'll be for the 9th of August!

'Til next time!
