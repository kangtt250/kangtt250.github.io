  A continuation on my search for knowledge in generating custom tilemaps, as well as a small note on fixing Katt's weapon fire mechanic.

This week I continued to look into the possibility of getting Unity to generate a tilemap made up of my custom 
"AngleTiles". More below.

# Angle Tile

After having installed Unity's 2D extras into the project, I decided to study their scripts to see how they were 
able to hook into Unity's Editor and appear as custom Tiles and Brushes in the Tilemap Editor. The scripts didn't 
seem much different from the script I based my "AngleTile" script on (The "AcidTile" script seen in this [video](https://youtu.be/C_zKWMzJNLY) I 
mentioned last week). Around this time I was getting a number of errors with my angle tile script, with various 
names and classes not being recognised.

A lot of class names seemed to be missing or unrecognised by my script, not mentioned in the video I used for reference.

After seeing no difference in Unity's add-on tilemap scripts, I eventually noticed that those scripts were in 
their own "Tilemap" directory within the main Assets folder. I realised that the scripts inside this Tilemap folder
were each within their own folder called "Editor". I knew that certain scripts will only work if they are within a
folder of a particular name, like "Assembly" or, as previously mentioned, "Editor". I decided to try placing my 
scripts for the angle tile and the angle brush into a similar directory to Unity's chosen directory, thinking this 
might rectify some of the errors in my scripts.

My attempt to ensure my scripts were in the proper directory, by keeping them uniform with Unity's tilemap directories.

Unfortunately this change in directory has not helped me rectify the issues with my script, I'm afraid I'll have 
to keep looking into it.

# Weapon Fire Fixes

During the week Adrian came to me with an issue regarding his weapon fire script: Katt would only shoot to the 
right of the screen, even if she was facing to the left. It took some analysis of his scripts first, but it was 
simple enough to tidy up his existing code and make use of some bools and if checks to fix the issue. I also made 
sure that his script referenced the inputs I had set up in [week six](https://teamviteza.github.io/jack/2019-05-17-entry-vi/).
The weapon will now fire in the direction Katt is facing, but only in an arc parallel to the ground. The next step 
is to get her to fire bullets from whichever angle she's slanted at (for example, she would fire bullets at a 45 
degree angle while she's travelling up a 45 degree angle slope.)

That's all for this week, next week hopefully I can finally figure out this tilemap puzzle.

'Til next time!
