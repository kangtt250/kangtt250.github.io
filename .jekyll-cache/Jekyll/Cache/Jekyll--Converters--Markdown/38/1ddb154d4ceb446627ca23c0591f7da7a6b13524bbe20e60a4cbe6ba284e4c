I"<p>Not much to say this week as I’ve been out of town for much of it.</p>

<h1 id="projectile-direction-issues">Projectile Direction Issues</h1>

<p>Apart from planning the final preparations for the game this week, I fixed the blaster so that it will always fire
from the direction that Katt is slanted at. It turns out the solution was incredibly simple and something I had forgotten
about completely: Transform.right, The X axis of a transform. Using this, since the blaster is parented to Katt, 
projectiles will always fire toward whatever her sprite is facing, be she facing right, left, up or down. As a 
result, Katt’s blaster is now fully functional!</p>

The different angles Katt can fire her blaster at.</p>

<p>That’s all for this week, next week is the final week for this project, so it’s going to be quite a busy one for us.
Wish us luck!</p>

<p>‘Til next time!</p>
