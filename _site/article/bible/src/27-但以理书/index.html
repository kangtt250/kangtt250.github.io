These he carried off to the temple of his god in Babylonia and put in the treasure house of his god.<p>主将犹大王约雅敬，并神殿中器皿的几份交付他手，他就把这器皿带到示拿地，收入他　神的庙里，放在他　神的库中。</blockquote><p>但1:3<blockquote><p>Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, chief of his court officials, to bring in some of the Israelites from the royal family and the nobility–<p>王吩咐太监长亚施毗拿从以色列人的宗室和贵胄中带进几个人来，</blockquote><p>但1:4<blockquote><p>young men without any physical defect, handsome, showing aptitude for every kind of learning, well informed, quick to understand, and qualified to serve in the king’s palace. He was to teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians.<p>就是年少没有残疾、相貌俊美、通达各样学问、知识聪明俱备、足能侍立在王宫里的，要教他们迦勒底的文字言语。</blockquote><p>但1:5<blockquote><p>The king assigned them a daily amount of food and wine from the king’s table. They were to be trained for three years, and after that they were to enter the king’s service.<p>王派定将自己所用的膳和所饮的酒，每日赐他们一份，养他们三年。满了三年，好叫他们在王面前侍立。</blockquote><p>但1:6<blockquote><p>Among these were some from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.<p>他们中间有犹大族的人但以理、哈拿尼雅、米沙利、亚撒利雅。</blockquote><p>但1:7<blockquote><p>The chief official gave them new names: to Daniel, the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego.<p>太监长给他们起名，称但以理为伯提沙撒，称哈拿尼雅为沙得拉，称米沙利为米煞，称亚撒利雅为亚伯尼歌。</blockquote><p>但1:8<blockquote><p>But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine, and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself this way.<p>但以理却立志不以王的膳和王所饮的酒玷污自己，所以求太监长容他不玷污自己。</blockquote><p>但1:9<blockquote><p>Now God had caused the official to show favor and sympathy to Daniel,<p>神使但以理在太监长眼前蒙恩惠，受怜悯。</blockquote><p>但1:10<blockquote><p>but the official told Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord the king, who has assigned your food and drink. Why should he see you looking worse than the other young men your age? The king would then have my head because of you.”<p>太监长对但以理说：“我惧怕我主我王，他已经派定你们的饮食，倘若他见你们的面貌比你们同岁的少年人肌瘦，怎么好呢？这样，你们就使我的头在王那里难保。”</blockquote><p>但1:11<blockquote><p>Daniel then said to the guard whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah,<p>但以理对太监长所派管理但以理、哈拿尼雅、米沙利、亚撒利雅的委办说：</blockquote><p>但1:12<blockquote><p>“Please test your servants for ten days: Give us nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink.<p>“求你试试仆人们十天，给我们素菜吃，白水喝，</blockquote><p>但1:13<blockquote><p>Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food, and treat your servants in accordance with what you see.”<p>然后看看我们的面貌和用王膳那少年人的面貌，就照你所看的待仆人吧！”</blockquote><p>但1:14<blockquote><p>So he agreed to this and tested them for ten days.<p>委办便允准他们这件事，试看他们十天。</blockquote><p>但1:15<blockquote><p>At the end of the ten days they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food.<p>过了十天，见他们的面貌比用王膳的一切少年人更加俊美肥胖。</blockquote><p>但1:16<blockquote><p>So the guard took away their choice food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables instead.<p>于是，委办撤去派他们用的膳、饮的酒，给他们素菜吃。</blockquote><p>但1:17<blockquote><p>To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds.<p>这四个少年人，　神在各样文字学问上（“学问”原文作“智慧”）赐给他们聪明知识，但以理又明白各样的异象和梦兆。</blockquote><p>但1:18<blockquote><p>At the end of the time set by the king to bring them in, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar.<p>尼布甲尼撒王预定带进少年人来的日期满了，太监长就把他们带到王面前。</blockquote><p>但1:19<blockquote><p>The king talked with them, and he found none equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king’s service.<p>王与他们谈论，见少年人中无一人能比但以理、哈拿尼雅、米沙利、亚撒利雅，所以留他们在王面前侍立。</blockquote><p>但1:20<blockquote><p>In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom.<p>王考问他门一切事，就见他们的智慧聪明比通国的术士和用法术的胜过十倍。</blockquote><p>但1:21<blockquote><p>And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.<p>到古列王元年，但以理还在。</blockquote><h2 id="但以理书第2章">但以理书第2章</h2><p>但2:1<blockquote><p>In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his mind was troubled and he could not sleep.<p>尼布甲尼撒在位第二年，他做了梦，心里烦乱，不能睡觉。</blockquote><p>但2:2<blockquote><p>So the king summoned the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers to tell him what he had dreamed. When they came in and stood before the king,<p>王吩咐人将术士、用法术的、行邪术的和迦勒底人召来，要他们将王的梦告诉王，他们就来站在王前。</blockquote><p>但2:3<blockquote><p>he said to them, “I have had a dream that troubles me and I want to know what it means.”<p>王对他们说：“我做了一梦，心里烦乱，要知道这是什么梦。”</blockquote><p>但2:4<blockquote><p>Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic, “O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it.”<p>迦勒底人用亚兰的言语对王说：“愿王万岁！请将那梦告诉仆人，仆人就可以讲解。”</blockquote><p>但2:5<blockquote><p>The king replied to the astrologers, “This is what I have firmly decided: If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it, I will have you cut into pieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble.<p>王回答迦勒底人说，梦我已经忘了（或作我已定命八节同），你们若不将梦和梦的讲解告诉我，就必被凌迟，你们的房屋必成为粪堆。</blockquote><p>但2:6<blockquote><p>But if you tell me the dream and explain it, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and interpret it for me.”<p>你们若将梦和梦的讲解告诉我，就必从我这里得赠品和赏赐，并大尊荣。现在你们要将梦和梦的讲解告诉我。”</blockquote><p>但2:7<blockquote><p>Once more they replied, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it.”<p>他们第二次对王说：“请王将梦告诉仆人，仆人就可以讲解。”</blockquote><p>但2:8<blockquote><p>Then the king answered, “I am certain that you are trying to gain time, because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided:<p>王回答说：“我准知道你们是故意迟延，因为你们知道那梦我已经忘了。</blockquote><p>但2:9<blockquote><p>If you do not tell me the dream, there is just one penalty for you. You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the situation will change. So then, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can interpret it for me.”<p>你们若不将梦告诉我，只有一法待你们，因为你们预备了谎言乱语向我说，要等候时势改变。现在你们要将梦告诉我，因我知道你们能将梦的讲解告诉我。”</blockquote><p>但2:10<blockquote><p>The astrologers answered the king, “There is not a man on earth who can do what the king asks! No king, however great and mighty, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer.<p>迦勒底人在王面前回答说：“世上没有人能将王所问的事说出来；因为没有君王、大臣、掌权的向术士，或用法术的，或迦勒底人问过这样的事。</blockquote><p>但2:11<blockquote><p>What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among men.”<p>王所问的事甚难，除了不与世人同居的神明，没有人在王面前能说出来。”</blockquote><p>但2:12<blockquote><p>This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon.<p>因此，王气忿忿地大发烈怒，吩咐灭绝巴比伦所有的哲士。</blockquote><p>但2:13<blockquote><p>So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death.<p>于是命令发出，哲士将要见杀，人就寻找但以理和他的同伴，要杀他们。</blockquote><p>但2:14<blockquote><p>When Arioch, the commander of the king’s guard, had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact.<p>王的护卫长亚略出来，要杀巴比伦的哲士，但以理就用婉言回答他，</blockquote><p>但2:15<blockquote><p>He asked the king’s officer, “Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?” Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel.<p>向王的护卫长亚略说：“王的命令为何这样紧急呢？”亚略就将情节告诉但以理。</blockquote><p>但2:16<blockquote><p>At this, Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him.<p>但以理遂进去求王宽限，就可以将梦的讲解告诉王。</blockquote><p>但2:17<blockquote><p>Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.<p>但以理回到他的居所，将这事告诉他的同伴哈拿尼雅、米沙利、亚撒利雅，</blockquote><p>但2:18<blockquote><p>He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.<p>要他们祈求天上的　神施怜悯，将这奥秘的事指明，免得但以理和他的同伴与巴比伦其余的哲士一同灭亡。</blockquote><p>但2:19<blockquote><p>During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven<p>这奥秘的事就在夜间异象中给但以理显明，但以理便称颂天上的　神。</blockquote><p>但2:20<blockquote><p>and said: “Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever; wisdom and power are his.<p>但以理说：“　神的名是应当称颂的，从亘古直到永远！因为智慧能力都属乎他。</blockquote><p>但2:21<blockquote><p>He changes times and seasons; he sets up kings and deposes them. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning.<p>他改变时候、日期、废王、立王，将智慧赐与智慧人，将知识赐与聪明人。</blockquote><p>但2:22<blockquote><p>He reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with him.<p>他显明深奥隐秘的事，知道暗中所有的，光明也与他同居。</blockquote><p>但2:23<blockquote><p>I thank and praise you, O God of my fathers: You have given me wisdom and power, you have made known to me what we asked of you, you have made known to us the dream of the king.”<p>我列祖的　神啊，我感谢你、赞美你，因你将智慧才能赐给我，允准我们所求的，把王的事给我们指明。”</blockquote><p>但2:24<blockquote><p>Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, “Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him.”<p>于是，但以理进去见亚略，就是王所派灭绝巴比伦哲士的，对他说：“不要灭绝巴比伦的哲士，求你领我到王面前，我要将梦的讲解告诉王。”</blockquote><p>但2:25<blockquote><p>Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said, “I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means.”<p>亚略就急忙将但以理领到王面前，对王说：“我在被掳的犹大人中遇见一人，他能将梦的讲解告诉王。”</blockquote><p>但2:26<blockquote><p>The king asked Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), “Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?”<p>王问称为伯提沙撒的但以理说：“你能将我所做的梦和梦的讲解告诉我吗？”</blockquote><p>但2:27<blockquote><p>Daniel replied, “No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about,<p>但以理在王面前回答说：“王所问的那奥秘事，哲士、用法术的、术士、观兆的都不能告诉王，</blockquote><p>但2:28<blockquote><p>but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you lay on your bed are these:<p>只有一位在天上的　神，能显明奥秘的事，他已将日后必有的事指示尼布甲尼撒王。你的梦和你在床上脑中的异象是这样：</blockquote><p>但2:29<blockquote><p>“As you were lying there, O king, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen.<p>王啊，你在床上想到后来的事，那显明奥秘事的主把将来必有的事指示你。</blockquote><p>但2:30<blockquote><p>As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than other living men, but so that you, O king, may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind.<p>至于那奥秘的事显明给我，并非因我的智慧胜过一切活人，乃为使王知道梦的讲解和心里的思念。</blockquote><p>但2:31<blockquote><p>“You looked, O king, and there before you stood a large statue–an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance.<p>王啊，你梦见一个大像，这像甚高，极其光耀，站在你面前，形状甚是可怕。</blockquote><p>但2:32<blockquote><p>The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze,<p>这像的头是精金的，胸膛和膀臂是银的，肚腹和腰是铜的，</blockquote><p>但2:33<blockquote><p>its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay.<p>腿是铁的，脚是半铁半泥的。</blockquote><p>但2:34<blockquote><p>While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them.<p>你观看，见有一块非人手凿出来的石头打在这像半铁半泥的脚上，把脚砸碎，</blockquote><p>但2:35<blockquote><p>Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were broken to pieces at the same time and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth.<p>于是金、银、铜、铁、泥都一同砸得粉碎，成如夏天禾场上的糠秕，被风吹散，无处可寻。打碎这像的石头变成一座大山，充满天下。</blockquote><p>但2:36<blockquote><p>“This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king.<p>这就是那梦，我们在王面前要讲解那梦。</blockquote><p>但2:37<blockquote><p>You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory;<p>王啊，你是诸王之王，天上的　神已将国度、权柄、能力、尊荣都赐给你。</blockquote><p>但2:38<blockquote><p>in your hands he has placed mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds of the air. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all.

He will distribute plunder, loot and wealth among his followers. He will plot the overthrow of fortresses–but only for a time.<p>趁人坦然无备的时候，他必来到国中极肥美之地，行他列祖和他列祖之祖所未曾行的，将掳物、掠物和财宝散给众人，又要设计攻打保障，然而这都是暂时的。</blockquote><p>但11:25<blockquote><p>“With a large army he will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South. The king of the South will wage war with a large and very powerful army, but he will not be able to stand because of the plots devised against him.<p>他必奋勇向前，率领大军攻击南方王，南方王也必以极大极强的军兵与他争战，却站立不住，因为有人设计谋害南方王。</blockquote><p>但11:26<blockquote><p>Those who eat from the king’s provisions will try to destroy him; his army will be swept away, and many will fall in battle.<p>吃王膳的，必败坏他，他的军队必被冲没，而且被杀的甚多。</blockquote><p>但11:27<blockquote><p>The two kings, with their hearts bent on evil, will sit at the same table and lie to each other, but to no avail, because an end will still come at the appointed time.<p>至于这二王，他们心怀恶计，同席说谎，计谋却不成就，因为到了定期，事就了结。</blockquote><p>但11:28<blockquote><p>The king of the North will return to his own country with great wealth, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant. He will take action against it and then return to his own country.<p>北方王（原文作“他”）必带许多财宝回往本国，他的心反对圣约，任意而行，回到本地。</blockquote><p>但11:29<blockquote><p>“At the appointed time he will invade the South again, but this time the outcome will be different from what it was before.<p>到了定期，他必返回，来到南方，后一次却不如前一次，</blockquote><p>但11:30<blockquote><p>Ships of the western coastlands will oppose him, and he will lose heart. Then he will turn back and vent his fury against the holy covenant. He will return and show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant.<p>因为基提战船必来攻击他，他就丧胆而回，又要恼恨圣约，任意而行。他必回来联络背弃圣约的人。</blockquote><p>但11:31<blockquote><p>“His armed forces will rise up to desecrate the temple fortress and will abolish the daily sacrifice. Then they will set up the abomination that causes desolation.<p>他必兴兵，这兵必亵渎圣地，就是保障。除掉常献的燔祭，设立那行毁坏可憎的。</blockquote><p>但11:32<blockquote><p>With flattery he will corrupt those who have violated the covenant, but the people who know their God will firmly resist him.<p>作恶违背圣约的人，他必用巧言勾引；惟独认识　神的子民必刚强行事。</blockquote><p>但11:33<blockquote><p>“Those who are wise will instruct many, though for a time they will fall by the sword or be burned or captured or plundered.<p>民间的智慧人必训诲多人，然而他们多日必倒在刀下，或被火烧，或被掳掠抢夺。</blockquote><p>但11:34<blockquote><p>When they fall, they will receive a little help, and many who are not sincere will join them.<p>他们仆倒的时候，稍得扶助，却有许多人用谄媚的话亲近他们。</blockquote><p>但11:35<blockquote><p>Some of the wise will stumble, so that they may be refined, purified and made spotless until the time of the end, for it will still come at the appointed time.<p>智慧人中有些仆倒的，为要熬炼其余的人，使他们清净洁白，直到末了，因为到了定期，事就了结。</blockquote><p>但11:36<blockquote><p>“The king will do as he pleases. He will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will say unheard-of things against the God of gods. He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed, for what has been determined must take place.<p>王必任意而行，自高自大，超过所有的　神，又用奇异的话攻击万　神之神。他必行事亨通，直到主的忿怒完毕，因为所定的事必然成就。</blockquote><p>但11:37<blockquote><p>He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the one desired by women, nor will he regard any god, but will exalt himself above them all.<p>他必不顾他列祖的　神，也不顾妇女所羡慕的　神，无论何　神他都不顾，因为他必自大，高过一切。</blockquote><p>但11:38<blockquote><p>Instead of them, he will honor a god of fortresses; a god unknown to his fathers he will honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts.<p>他倒要敬拜保障的　神，用金、银、宝石和可爱之物敬奉他列祖所不认识的　神。</blockquote><p>但11:39<blockquote><p>He will attack the mightiest fortresses with the help of a foreign god and will greatly honor those who acknowledge him. He will make them rulers over many people and will distribute the land at a price.<p>他必靠外邦　神的帮助，攻破最坚固的保障。凡承认他的，他必将荣耀加给他们，使他们管辖许多人，又为贿赂分地与他们。</blockquote><p>但11:40<blockquote><p>“At the time of the end the king of the South will engage him in battle, and the king of the North will storm out against him with chariots and cavalry and a great fleet of ships. He will invade many countries and sweep through them like a flood.<p>到末了，南方王要与他交战，北方王必用战车、马兵和许多战船，势如暴风来攻击他，也必进入列国如洪水泛滥。</blockquote><p>但11:41<blockquote><p>He will also invade the Beautiful Land. Many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab and the leaders of Ammon will be delivered from his hand.<p>又必进入那荣美之地，有许多国就被倾覆，但以东人、摩押人和一大半亚扪人必脱离他的手。</blockquote><p>但11:42<blockquote><p>He will extend his power over many countries; Egypt will not escape.<p>他必伸手攻击列国，埃及地也不得脱离。</blockquote><p>但11:43<blockquote><p>He will gain control of the treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of Egypt, with the Libyans and Nubians in submission.<p>他必把持埃及的金银财宝和各样的宝物。吕彼亚人和古实人都必跟从他。</blockquote><p>但11:44<blockquote><p>But reports from the east and the north will alarm him, and he will set out in a great rage to destroy and annihilate many.<p>但从东方和北方必有消息扰乱他，他就大发烈怒出去，要将多人杀灭净尽。</blockquote><p>但11:45<blockquote><p>He will pitch his royal tents between the seas at the beautiful holy mountain. Yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him.<p>他必在海和荣美的圣山中间设立他如宫殿的帐幕；然而到了他的结局，必无人能帮助他。</blockquote><h2 id="但以理书第12章">但以理书第12章</h2><p>但12:1<blockquote><p>“At that time Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will arise. There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then. But at that time your people–everyone whose name is found written in the book–will be delivered.<p>那时，保佑你本国之民的天使长（原文作“大君”）米迦勒必站起来，并且有大艰难，从有国以来直到此时，没有这样的。你本国的民中，凡名录在册上的，必得拯救。</blockquote><p>但12:2<blockquote><p>Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt.<p>睡在尘埃中的，必有多人复醒，其中有得永生的，有受羞辱、永远被憎恶的。</blockquote><p>但12:3<blockquote><p>Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever.<p>智慧人必发光，如同天上的光；那使多人归义的，必发光如星，直到永永远远。</blockquote><p>但12:4<blockquote><p>But you, Daniel, close up and seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end. Many will go here and there to increase knowledge.”<p>但以理啊，你要隐藏这话，封闭这书，直到末时。必有多人来往奔跑（或作“切心研究”），知识就必增长。”</blockquote><p>但12:5<blockquote><p>Then I, Daniel, looked, and there before me stood two others, one on this bank of the river and one on the opposite bank.<p>我但以理观看，见另有两个人站立，一个在河这边，一个在河那边。</blockquote><p>但12:6<blockquote><p>One of them said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, “How long will it be before these astonishing things are fulfilled?”<p>有一个问那站在河水以上、穿细麻衣的说：“这奇异的事到几时才应验呢？”</blockquote><p>但12:7<blockquote><p>The man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, lifted his right hand and his left hand toward heaven, and I heard him swear by him who lives forever, saying, “It will be for a time, times and half a time. When the power of the holy people has been finally broken, all these things will be completed.”<p>我听见那站在河水以上、穿细麻衣的，向天举起左右手，指着活到永远的主起誓说：“要到一载、二载、半载，打破圣民权力的时候，这一切事就都应验了。”</blockquote><p>但12:8<blockquote><p>I heard, but I did not understand. So I asked, “My lord, what will the outcome of all this be?”<p>我听见这话，却不明白，就说：“我主啊，这些事的结局是怎样呢？”</blockquote><p>但12:9<blockquote><p>He replied, “Go your way, Daniel, because the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end.<p>他说：“但以理啊，你只管去，因为这话已经隐藏封闭，直到末时。</blockquote><p>但12:10<blockquote><p>Many will be purified, made spotless and refined, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. None of the wicked will understand, but those who are wise will understand.<p>必有许多人使自己清净洁白，且被熬炼，但恶人仍必行恶，一切恶人都不明白，惟独智慧人能明白。</blockquote><p>但12:11<blockquote><p>“From the time that the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days.<p>从除掉常献的燔祭，并设立那行毁坏可憎之物的时候，必有一千二百九十日。</blockquote><p>但12:12<blockquote><p>Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the 1,335 days.<p>等到一千三百三十五日的，那人便为有福。</blockquote><p>但12:13<blockquote><p>“As for you, go your way till the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance.”<p>你且去等候结局，因为你必安歇。到了末期，你必起来，享受你的福分。”</blockquote></article><footer role="contentinfo"><hr/><p><small class="copyright">© Seon Zhu 2022.
