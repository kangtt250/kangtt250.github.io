# Now, here is Naval in his own words…

现在，这是纳瓦尔用他自己的话说的…

## Background 背景

I grew up in a single -parent household with my mom working, going to school, and raising my brother and me as latchkey kids. We were very self -sufficient from a very early age. There was a lot of hardship, but everyone goes through hardship. It did help me in a number of ways.

我在一个单亲家庭长大，母亲工作、上学，把我和弟弟作为钥匙孩子抚养长大。我们从很小的时候就非常自给自足。有很多困难，但每个人都经历过困难。它确实在很多方面帮助了我。

We were poor immigrants. My dad came to the US—he was a pharmacist in India. But his degree wasn’t accepted here, so he worked in a hardware store. Not a great upbringing, you know. My family split up. [47]

我们是贫穷的移民。我父亲来到美国--他是印度的一名药剂师。但是他的学位在这里没有被接受，所以他在一家五金店工作。你知道，教养不是很好。我的家庭分裂了。

My mother uniquely provided, against the background of hardship, unconditional and unfailing love. If you have nothing in your life, but you have at least one person that loves you unconditionally, it’ll do wonders for your self -esteem . [8]

在艰难困苦的背景下，我的母亲提供了独一无二的、无条件的、永无止境的爱。如果你的生活中什么都没有，但你至少有一个人无条件地爱着你，这会给你的自尊带来奇迹。

We were in a part of New York City that isn’t very safe. Basically, the library was my after -school center. After I came back from school, I would just go straight to the library and hang out there until they closed. Then, I would come home. That was my daily routine. [8]

我们当时在纽约市的一个不太安全的地方。基本上，图书馆是我的课后中心。放学回来后，我会直接去图书馆，在那里一直呆到他们关门。然后，我就会回家。那是我的日常生活。

We moved to the US when we were very young. I didn’t have many friends, so I wasn’t very confident. I spent a lot of time reading. My only real friends were books. Books make for great friends, because the best thinkers of the last few thousand years tell you their nuggets of wisdom. [8]

我们很小的时候就搬到了美国。我没有很多朋友，所以我不是很自信。我花了很多时间读书。我唯一真正的朋友是书。书籍造就伟大的朋友，因为过去几千年来最好的思想家会告诉你他们的宝贵智慧。

My first job was with an illegal catering company in the back of a van delivering Indian food when I was fifteen. Even when I was younger, I had a paper route and I washed dishes in the cafeteria.

我的第一份工作是在一家非法餐饮公司工作，当时我15岁，在一辆面包车的后座上运送印度食物。甚至在我年轻的时候，我也有送报纸的习惯，我在自助餐厅洗盘子。

I was a totally unknown kid in New York City from a nothing family, an “immigrants trying to survive” situation. Then, I passed the test to get into Stuyvesant High School. That saved my life, because once I had the Stuyvesant brand, I got into an Ivy League college, which led me into tech. Stuyvesant is one of those intelligence lottery situations where you can break in with instant validation. You go from being blue collar to white collar in one move. [73]

在纽约市，我是一个完全默默无闻的孩子，出身于一个一无所有的家庭，一种“试图生存的移民”的处境。然后，我通过了考试，进入了斯图文森高中(Stuyvesant High School)。这救了我的命，因为一旦我有了Stuyvesant品牌，我就进入了一所常春藤盟校，这让我进入了科技行业。Stuyvesant是智能彩票中的一种，你可以通过即时验证进入其中。你一下子从蓝领变成了白领。

At Dartmouth, I studied economics and computer science. There was a time when I thought I was going to be a PhD in economics. [8]

在达特茅斯，我学的是经济学和计算机科学。曾经有一段时间，我以为我会成为经济学博士。

Today, I’m an investor, personally, in about two hundred companies. Advisor to a bunch. I’m on a bunch of boards. I’m also a small partner in a cryptocurrency fund because I’m really into the potential of cryptocurrencies. I’m always cooking up something new. I always have a bunch of side projects. [4]

今天，我个人是大约200家公司的投资者。一群人的顾问。我在一堆冲浪板上。我也是一只加密货币基金的小合伙人，因为我真的很喜欢加密货币的潜力。我总是想出一些新的东西。我总是有一堆副业。

All that, of course, in addition to being the founder and chairman of AngelList. [4]

当然，除了是AngelList的创始人和董事长之外，所有这一切都是如此。

I was born poor and miserable. I’m now pretty well -off , and I’m very happy. I worked at those.

我生来贫穷而悲惨。我现在很富裕，我很幸福。我在那里工作过。

I’ve learned a few things, and some principles. I try to lay them out in a timeless manner, where you can figure it out for yourself. Because at the end of the day, I can’t quite teach anything. I can only inspire you and maybe give you a few hooks so you can remember. [77]

我学到了一些东西，也学到了一些原则。我试着用永恒的方式把它们摆出来，这样你就可以自己找出答案了。因为归根结底，我什么都教不了。我只能激励你，也许还能给你几个钩子，这样你就能记住了。“[77]
