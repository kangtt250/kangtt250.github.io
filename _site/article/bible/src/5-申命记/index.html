go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the mountains, in the western foothills, in the Negev and along the coast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the Euphrates.<p>要起行转到亚摩利人的山地和靠近这山地的各处，就是亚拉巴、山地、高原、南地、沿海一带，迦南人的地并黎巴嫩山，又到伯拉大河。</blockquote><p>申1:8<blockquote><p>See, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land that the LORD swore he would give to your fathers–to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob–and to their descendants after them.”<p>如今我将这地摆在你们面前，你们要进去得这地，就是耶和华向你们列祖亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各起誓应许赐给他们和他们后裔为业之地。’</blockquote><p>申1:9<blockquote><p>At that time I said to you, “You are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone.<p>那时我对你们说：‘管理你们的重任，我独自担当不起。</blockquote><p>申1:10<blockquote><p>The LORD your God has increased your numbers so that today you are as many as the stars in the sky.<p>耶和华你们的　神使你们多起来。看哪！你们今日像天上的星那样多。</blockquote><p>申1:11<blockquote><p>May the LORD, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand times and bless you as he has promised!<p>惟愿耶和华你们列祖的　神使你们比如今更多千倍，照他所应许你们的话赐福与你们。</blockquote><p>申1:12<blockquote><p>But how can I bear your problems and your burdens and your disputes all by myself?<p>但你们的麻烦，和管理你们的重任，并你们的争讼，我独自一人怎能担当得起呢？</blockquote><p>申1:13<blockquote><p>Choose some wise, understanding and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will set them over you.”<p>你们要按着各支派选举有智慧、有见识、为众人所认识的，我立他们为你们的首领。’</blockquote><p>申1:14<blockquote><p>You answered me, “What you propose to do is good.”<p>你们回答我说：‘照你所说的行了为妙。’</blockquote><p>申1:15<blockquote><p>So I took the leading men of your tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them to have authority over you–as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens and as tribal officials.<p>我便将你们各支派的首领，有智慧、为众人所认识的，照你们的支派，立他们为官长、千夫长、百夫长、五十夫长、十夫长，管理你们。</blockquote><p>申1:16<blockquote><p>And I charged your judges at that time: Hear the disputes between your brothers and judge fairly, whether the case is between brother Israelites or between one of them and an alien.<p>当时，我嘱咐你们的审判官说：‘你们听讼，无论是弟兄彼此争讼，是与同居的外人争讼，都要按公义判断。</blockquote><p>申1:17<blockquote><p>Do not show partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be afraid of any man, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too hard for you, and I will hear it.<p>审判的时候，不可看人的外貌；听讼不可分贵贱，不可惧怕人，因为审判是属乎　神的。若有难断的案件，可以呈到我这里，我就判断。’</blockquote><p>申1:18<blockquote><p>And at that time I told you everything you were to do.<p>那时，我将你们所当行的事都吩咐你们了。</blockquote><p>申1:19<blockquote><p>Then, as the LORD our God commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the Amorites through all that vast and dreadful desert that you have seen, and so we reached Kadesh Barnea.<p>我们照着耶和华我们　神所吩咐的，从何烈山起行，经过你们所看见那大而可怕的旷野，往亚摩利人的山地去，到了加低斯巴尼亚。</blockquote><p>申1:20<blockquote><p>Then I said to you, “You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us.<p>我对你们说：‘你们已经到了耶和华我们　神所赐给我们的亚摩利人之山地。</blockquote><p>申1:21<blockquote><p>See, the LORD your God has given you the land. Go up and take possession of it as the LORD, the God of your fathers, told you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.”<p>看哪！耶和华你的　神已将那地摆在你面前，你要照耶和华你列祖的　神所说的上去得那地为业，不要惧怕，也不要惊惶。’</blockquote><p>申1:22<blockquote><p>Then all of you came to me and said, “Let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to.”<p>你们都就近我来说：‘我们要先打发人去，为我们窥探那地，将我们上去该走何道，必进何城，都回报我们。’</blockquote><p>申1:23<blockquote><p>The idea seemed good to me; so I selected twelve of you, one man from each tribe.<p>这话我以为美，就从你们中间选了十二个人，每支派一人。</blockquote><p>申1:24<blockquote><p>They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and explored it.<p>于是，他们起身上山地去，到以实各谷，窥探那地。</blockquote><p>申1:25<blockquote><p>Taking with them some of the fruit of the land, they brought it down to us and reported, “It is a good land that the LORD our God is giving us.”<p>他们手里拿着那地的果子下来，到我们那里回报说：‘耶和华我们的　神所赐给我们的是美地。’</blockquote><p>申1:26<blockquote><p>But you were unwilling to go up; you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God.<p>你们却不肯上去，竟违背了耶和华你们　神的命令，</blockquote><p>申1:27<blockquote><p>You grumbled in your tents and said, “The LORD hates us; so he brought us out of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us.<p>在帐棚内发怨言说：‘耶和华因为恨我们，所以将我们从埃及地领出来，要交在亚摩利人手中，除灭我们。</blockquote><p>申1:28<blockquote><p>Where can we go? Our brothers have made us lose heart. They say, ‘The people are stronger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls up to the sky. We even saw the Anakites there.’”<p>我们上哪里去呢？我们的弟兄使我们的心消化，说那地的民比我们又大又高，城邑又广大又坚固，高得顶天，并且我们在那里看见亚衲族的人。’</blockquote><p>申1:29<blockquote><p>Then I said to you, “Do not be terrified; do not be afraid of them.<p>我就对你们说：‘不要惊恐，也不要怕他们。</blockquote><p>申1:30<blockquote><p>The LORD your God, who is going before you, will fight for you, as he did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes,<p>在你们前面行的耶和华你们的　神必为你们争战，正如他在埃及和旷野，在你们眼前所行的一样。</blockquote><p>申1:31<blockquote><p>and in the desert. There you saw how the LORD your God carried you, as a father carries his son, all the way you went until you reached this place.”<p>你们在旷野所行的路上，也曾见耶和华你们的　神抚养你们，如同人抚养儿子一般，直等你们来到这地方。’</blockquote><p>申1:32<blockquote><p>In spite of this, you did not trust in the LORD your God,<p>你们在这事上却不信耶和华你们的　神。</blockquote><p>申1:33<blockquote><p>who went ahead of you on your journey, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go.<p>他在路上，在你们前面行，为你们找安营的地方。夜间在火柱里，日间在云柱里，指示你们所当行的路。</blockquote><p>申1:34<blockquote><p>When the LORD heard what you said, he was angry and solemnly swore:<p>耶和华听见你们这话，就发怒起誓说：</blockquote><p>申1:35<blockquote><p>“Not a man of this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your forefathers,<p>‘这恶世代的人连一个也不得见我起誓应许赐给你们列祖的美地；</blockquote><p>申1:36<blockquote><p>except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on, because he followed the LORD wholeheartedly.”<p>惟有耶孚尼的儿子迦勒必得看见，并且我要将他所踏过的地赐给他和他的子孙，因为他专心跟从我。’</blockquote><p>申1:37<blockquote><p>Because of you the LORD became angry with me also and said, “You shall not enter it, either.<p>耶和华为你的缘故也向我发怒说：‘你必不得进入那地。</blockquote><p>申1:38<blockquote><p>But your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will enter it. Encourage him, because he will lead Israel to inherit it.<p>伺候你、嫩的儿子约书亚，他必得进入那地，你要勉励他，因为他要使以色列人承受那地为业，</blockquote><p>申1:39<blockquote><p>And the little ones that you said would be taken captive, your children who do not yet know good from bad–they will enter the land. I will give it to them and they will take possession of it.<p>并且你们的妇人孩子，就是你们所说必被掳掠的和今日不知善恶的儿女，必进入那地。我要将那地赐给他们，他们必得为业。</blockquote><p>申1:40<blockquote><p>But as for you, turn around and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea.”<p>至于你们，要转回，从红海的路往旷野去。’</blockquote><p>申1:41<blockquote><p>Then you replied, “We have sinned against the LORD. We will go up and fight, as the LORD our God commanded us.” So every one of you put on his weapons, thinking it easy to go up into the hill country.<p>那时，你们回答我说：‘我们得罪了耶和华，情愿照耶和华我们　神一切所吩咐的上去争战。’于是你们各人带着兵器，争先上山地去了。</blockquote><p>申1:42<blockquote><p>But the LORD said to me, “Tell them, ‘Do not go up and fight, because I will not be with you. You will be defeated by your enemies.’”<p>耶和华吩咐我说：‘你对他们说：不要上去，也不要争战，因我不在你们中间，恐怕你们被仇敌杀败了。’</blockquote><p>申1:43<blockquote><p>So I told you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the LORD’S command and in your arrogance you marched up into the hill country.<p>我就告诉了你们，你们却不听从，竟违背耶和华的命令，擅自上山地去了。</blockquote><p>申1:44<blockquote><p>The Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you; they chased you like a swarm of bees and beat you down from Seir all the way to Hormah.<p>住那山地的亚摩利人就出来攻击你们，追赶你们如蜂拥一般，在西珥杀退你们，直到何珥玛。</blockquote><p>申1:45<blockquote><p>You came back and wept before the LORD, but he paid no attention to your weeping and turned a deaf ear to you.<p>你们便回来，在耶和华面前哭号；耶和华却不听你们的声音，也不向你们侧耳。</blockquote><p>申1:46<blockquote><p>And so you stayed in Kadesh many days–all the time you spent there.<p>于是，你们在加低斯住了许多日子。</blockquote><h2 id="申命记第2章">申命记第2章</h2><p>申2:1<blockquote><p>Then we turned back and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea, as the LORD had directed me. For a long time we made our way around the hill country of Seir.<p>此后，我们转回，从红海的路往旷野去，是照耶和华所吩咐我的；我们在西珥山绕行了许多日子。</blockquote><p>申2:2<blockquote><p>Then the LORD said to me,<p>耶和华对我说：</blockquote><p>申2:3<blockquote><p>“You have made your way around this hill country long enough; now turn north.<p>‘你们绕行这山的日子够了，要转向北去。</blockquote><p>申2:4<blockquote><p>Give the people these orders: ‘You are about to pass through the territory of your brothers the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, but be very careful.<p>你吩咐百姓说：你们弟兄以扫的子孙住在西珥，你们要经过他们的境界，他们必惧怕你们，所以你们要分外谨慎。</blockquote><p>申2:5<blockquote><p>Do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, not even enough to put your foot on. I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his own.<p>不可与他们争战，他们的地，连脚掌可踏之处，我都不给你们，因我已将西珥山赐给以扫为业。</blockquote><p>申2:6<blockquote><p>You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.’”<p>你们要用钱向他们买粮吃，也要用钱向他们买水喝。’</blockquote><p>申2:7<blockquote><p>The LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this vast desert. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you, and you have not lacked anything.<p>因为耶和华你的　神，在你手里所办的一切事上，已赐福与你。你走这大旷野，他都知道了。这四十年，耶和华你的　神常与你同在，故此你一无所缺。</blockquote><p>申2:8<blockquote><p>So we went on past our brothers the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber, and traveled along the desert road of Moab.<p>于是，我们离了我们弟兄以扫子孙所住的西珥，从亚拉巴的路，经过以拉他、以旬迦别，转向摩押旷野的路去。</blockquote><p>申2:9<blockquote><p>Then the LORD said to me, “Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession.”<p>耶和华吩咐我说：‘不可扰害摩押人，也不可与他们争战。他们的地，我不赐给你为业，因我已将亚珥赐给罗得的子孙为业。’</blockquote><p>申2:10<blockquote><p>(The Emites used to live there–a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites.<p>（先前，有以米人住在那里，民数众多，身体高大，像亚衲人一样。</blockquote><p>申2:11<blockquote><p>Like the Anakites, they too were considered Rephaites, but the Moabites called them Emites.<p>这以米人像亚衲人，也算为利乏音人，摩押人称他们为以米人。</blockquote><p>申2:12<blockquote><p>Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out. They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did in the land the LORD gave them as their possession.)<p>先前，何利人也住在西珥，但以扫的子孙将他们除灭，得了他们的地，接着居住，就如以色列在耶和华赐给他为业之地所行的一样。）</blockquote><p>申2:13<blockquote><p>And the LORD said, “Now get up and cross the Zered Valley.” So we crossed the valley.<p>‘现在，起来过撒烈溪！’于是，我们过了撒烈溪。</blockquote><p>申2:14<blockquote><p>Thirty-eight years passed from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley.
