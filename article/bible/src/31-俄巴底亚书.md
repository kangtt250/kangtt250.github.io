俄1:1
> The vision of Obadiah. This is what the Sovereign LORD says about Edom--We have heard a message from the LORD: An envoy was sent to the nations to say, "Rise, and let us go against her for battle"--
>
> 俄巴底亚得了耶和华的默示。论以东说：“我从耶和华那里听见信息，并有使者被差往列国去，说：‘起来吧，一同起来与以东争战。’


俄1:2
> "See, I will make you small among the nations; you will be utterly despised.
>

俄1:3
> The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rocks and make your home on the heights, you who say to yourself, 'Who can bring me down to the ground?'
>
> 住在山穴中，居所在高处的啊，你因狂傲自欺，心里说：‘谁能将我拉下地去呢？’


俄1:4
> Though you soar like the eagle and make your nest among the stars, from there I will bring you down," declares the LORD.
>
> 你虽如大鹰高飞，在星宿之间搭窝，我必从那里拉下你来。”这是耶和华说的。


俄1:5
> "If thieves came to you, if robbers in the night--Oh, what a disaster awaits you--would they not steal only as much as they wanted? If grape pickers came to you, would they not leave a few grapes?
>
> “盗贼若来在你那里，或强盗夜间而来（你何竟被剪除），岂不偷窃，直到够了呢？摘葡萄的若来到你那里，岂不剩下些葡萄呢？


俄1:6
> But how Esau will be ransacked, his hidden treasures pillaged!
>
> 以扫的隐密处何竟被搜寻？他隐藏的宝物何竟被查出？


俄1:7
> All your allies will force you to the border; your friends will deceive and overpower you; those who eat your bread will set a trap for you, but you will not detect it.
>
> 与你结盟的都送你上路，直到交界；与你和好的欺骗你，且胜过你；与你一同吃饭的，设下网罗陷害你；在你心里毫无聪明。”


俄1:8
> "In that day," declares the LORD, "will I not destroy the wise men of Edom, men of understanding in the mountains of Esau?
>
> 耶和华说：“到那日，我岂不从以东除灭智慧人，从以扫山除灭聪明人？

>
> 提幔哪，你的勇士必惊惶，甚至以扫山的人都被杀戮剪除。

>
> 因你向兄弟雅各行强暴，羞愧必遮盖你，你也必永远断绝。


俄1:11
> On the day you stood aloof while strangers carried off his wealth and foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of them.
>
> 当外人掳掠雅各的财物，外邦人进入他的城门，为耶路撒冷拈阄的日子，你竟站在一旁，像与他们同夥。


俄1:12
> You should not look down on your brother in the day of his misfortune, nor rejoice over the people of Judah in the day of their destruction, nor boast so much in the day of their trouble.
>
> 你兄弟遭难的日子，你不当瞪眼看着；犹大人被灭的日子，你不当因此欢乐；他们遭难的日子，你不当说狂傲的话。


俄1:13
> You should not march through the gates of my people in the day of their disaster, nor look down on them in their calamity in the day of their disaster, nor seize their wealth in the day of their disaster.
>

俄1:14
> You should not wait at the crossroads to cut down their fugitives, nor hand over their survivors in the day of their trouble.
>
> 你不当站在岔路口，剪除他们中间逃脱的；他们遭难的日子，你不当将他们剩下的人交付仇敌。


俄1:15
> "The day of the LORD is near for all nations. As you have done, it will be done to you; your deeds will return upon your own head.
>
> 耶和华降罚的日子临近万国。你怎样行，他也必照样向你行，你的报应必归到你头上。


俄1:16
> Just as you drank on my holy hill, so all the nations will drink continually; they will drink and drink and be as if they had never been.
>
> 你们犹大人在我圣山怎样喝了苦杯，万国也必照样常常地喝；且喝且咽，他们就归于无有。


俄1:17
> But on Mount Zion will be deliverance; it will be holy, and the house of Jacob will possess its inheritance.
>
> 在锡安山必有逃脱的人，那山也必成圣；雅各家必得原有的产业。

>
> 雅各家必成为大火；约瑟家必为火焰。以扫家必如碎秸，火必将他烧着吞灭；以扫家必无余剩的。”这是耶和华说的。


俄1:19
