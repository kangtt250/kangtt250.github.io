# 路得记
## 路得记第1章
得1:1
> In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land, and a man from Bethlehem in Judah, together with his wife and two sons, went to live for a while in the country of Moab.
>
> 当士师秉政的时候，国中遭遇饥荒。在犹大伯利恒，有一个人带着妻子和两个儿子往摩押地去寄居。


得1:2
> The man's name was Elimelech, his wife's name Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to Moab and lived there.
>
> 这人名叫以利米勒，他的妻名叫拿俄米。他两个儿子：一个名叫玛伦，一个名叫基连，都是犹大伯利恒的以法他人。他们到了摩押地，就住在那里。


得1:3
> Now Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, and she was left with her two sons.
>
> 后来，拿俄米的丈夫以利米勒死了，剩下妇人和她两个儿子。


得1:4
> They married Moabite women, one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years,
>
> 这两个儿子娶了摩押女子为妻，一个名叫俄珥巴，一个名叫路得，在那里住了约有十年。


得1:5
> both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.
>
> 玛伦和基连二人也死了，剩下拿俄米，没有丈夫，也没有儿子。


得1:6
> When she heard in Moab that the LORD had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them, Naomi and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there.
>
> 她就与两个儿妇起身，要从摩押地归回，因为她在摩押地听见耶和华眷顾自己的百姓，赐粮食与他们。


得1:7
> With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah.
>
> 于是，她和两个儿妇起行离开所住的地方，要回犹大地去。


得1:8
> Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go back, each of you, to your mother's home. May the LORD show kindness to you, as you have shown to your dead and to me.
>
> 拿俄米对两个儿妇说：“你们各人回娘家去吧！愿耶和华恩待你们，像你们恩待已死的人与我一样。


得1:9
> May the LORD grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband." Then she kissed them and they wept aloud
>
> 愿耶和华使你们各在新夫家中得平安！”于是，拿俄米与她们亲嘴。她们就放声而哭，


得1:10
> and said to her, "We will go back with you to your people."
>
> 说：“不然，我们必与你一同回你本国去。”


得1:11
> But Naomi said, "Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands?
>
> 拿俄米说：“我女儿们哪，回去吧！为何要跟我去呢？我还能生子作你们的丈夫吗？


得1:12
> Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me--even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons--
>
> 我女儿们哪，回去吧！我年纪老迈，不能再有丈夫；即或说，我还有指望，今夜有丈夫可以生子，


得1:13
> would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the LORD'S hand has gone out against me!"
>
> 你们岂能等着他们长大呢？你们岂能等着他们不嫁别人呢？我女儿们哪，不要这样！我为你们的缘故甚是愁苦，因为耶和华伸手攻击我。”


得1:14
> At this they wept again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-by, but Ruth clung to her.
>
> 两个儿妇又放声而哭，俄珥巴与婆婆亲嘴而别，只是路得舍不得拿俄米。


得1:15
> "Look," said Naomi, "your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her."
>
> 拿俄米说：“看哪，你嫂子已经回她本国和她所拜的　神那里去了，你也跟着你嫂子回去吧！”


得1:16
> But Ruth replied, "Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God.
>
> 路得说：“不要催我回去不跟随你。你往哪里去，我也往那里去；你在哪里住宿，我也在那里住宿；你的国就是我的国，你的　神就是我的　神。


得1:17
> Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me."
>
> 你在哪里死，我也在那里死，也葬在那里。除非死能使你我相离，不然，愿耶和华重重地降罚与我！”


得1:18
> When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.
>
> 拿俄米见路得定意要跟随自己去，就不再劝她了。


得1:19
> So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, "Can this be Naomi?"
>
> 于是二人同行，来到伯利恒。她们到了伯利恒，合城的人就都惊讶。妇女们说：“这是拿俄米吗？”


得1:20
> "Don't call me Naomi," she told them. "Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter.
>
> 拿俄米对他们说：“不要叫我拿俄米（就是“甜”的意思），要叫我玛拉（就是“苦”的意思），因为全能者使我受了大苦。


得1:21
> I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The LORD has afflicted me; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me."
>
> 我满满地出去，耶和华使我空空地回来。耶和华降祸与我，全能者使我受苦。既是这样，你们为何还叫我拿俄米呢？”


得1:22
> So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.
>
> 拿俄米和她儿妇摩押女子路得，从摩押地回来到伯利恒，正是动手割大麦的时候。


## 路得记第2章
得2:1
> Now Naomi had a relative on her husband's side, from the clan of Elimelech, a man of standing, whose name was Boaz.
>
> 拿俄米的丈夫以利米勒的亲族中，有一个人名叫波阿斯，是个大财主。


得2:2
> And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, "Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor." Naomi said to her, "Go ahead, my daughter."
>
> 摩押女子路得对拿俄米说：“容我往田间去，我蒙谁的恩，就在谁的身后拾取麦穗。”拿俄米说：“女儿啊，你只管去。”


得2:3
> So she went out and began to glean in the fields behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she found herself working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelech.
>
> 路得就去了，来到田间，在收割的人身后拾取麦穗。她恰巧到了以利米勒本族的人波阿斯那块田里。


得2:4
> Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, "The LORD be with you!" "The LORD bless you!" they called back.
>
> 波阿斯正从伯利恒来，对收割的人说：“愿耶和华与你们同在！”他们回答说：“愿耶和华赐福与你！”


得2:5
> Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters, "Whose young woman is that?"
>
> 波阿斯问监管收割的仆人说：“那是谁家的女子？”


得2:6
> The foreman replied, "She is the Moabitess who came back from Moab with Naomi.
>
> 监管收割的仆人回答说：“是那摩押女子，跟随拿俄米从摩押地回来的。


得2:7
> She said, 'Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters.' She went into the field and has worked steadily from morning till now, except for a short rest in the shelter."
>
> 她说：‘请你容我跟着收割的人拾取打捆剩下的麦穗。’她从早晨直到如今，除了在屋子里坐一会儿，常在这里。”


得2:8
> So Boaz said to Ruth, "My daughter, listen to me. Don't go and glean in another field and don't go away from here. Stay here with my servant girls.
>
> 波阿斯对路得说：“女儿啊，听我说，不要往别人田里拾取麦穗，也不要离开这里，要常与我使女们在一处。


得2:9
> Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the girls. I have told the men not to touch you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled."
>
> 我的仆人在哪块田收割，你就跟着他们去。我已经吩咐仆人不可欺负你。你若渴了，就可以到器皿那里喝仆人打来的水。”


得2:10
> At this, she bowed down with her face to the ground. She exclaimed, "Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me--a foreigner?"
>
> 路得就俯伏在地叩拜，对他说：“我既是外邦人，怎么蒙你的恩，这样顾恤我呢？”


得2:11
> Boaz replied, "I've been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband--how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before.
>
> 波阿斯回答说：“自从你丈夫死后，凡你向婆婆所行的，并你离开父母和本地，到素不认识的民中，这些事人全都告诉我了。


得2:12
> May the LORD repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge."
>
> 愿耶和华照你所行的赏赐你。你来投靠耶和华以色列　神的翅膀下，愿你满得他的赏赐。”


得2:13
> "May I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord," she said. "You have given me comfort and have spoken kindly to your servant--though I do not have the standing of one of your servant girls."
>
> 路得说：“我主啊，愿在你眼前蒙恩！我虽然不及你的一个使女，你还用慈爱的话安慰我的心。”


得2:14
> At mealtime Boaz said to her, "Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar." When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over.
>
> 到了吃饭的时候，波阿斯对路得说：“你到这里来吃饼，将饼蘸在醋里。”路得就在收割的人旁边坐下，他们把烘了的穗子递给她，她吃饱了，还有余剩的。


得2:15
> As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, "Even if she gathers among the sheaves, don't embarrass her.
>
> 她起来又拾取麦穗，波阿斯吩咐仆人说：“她就是在捆中拾取麦穗，也可以容她，不可羞辱她。


得2:16
> Rather, pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up, and don't rebuke her."
>
> 并要从捆里抽出些来，留在地下任她拾取，不可叱吓她。”


得2:17
> So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed the barley she had gathered, and it amounted to about an ephah.
>
> 这样，路得在田间拾取麦穗，直到晚上，将所拾取的打了，约有一伊法大麦。


得2:18
> She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough.
>
> 她就把所拾取的带进城去给婆婆看，又把她吃饱了所剩的给了婆婆。


得2:19
> Her mother-in-law asked her, "Where did you glean today? Where did you work? Blessed be the man who took notice of you!" Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. "The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz," she said.
>
> 婆婆问她说：“你今日在哪里拾取麦穗，在哪里做工呢？愿那顾恤你的得福。”路得就告诉婆婆说：“我今日在一个名叫波阿斯的人那里做工。”


得2:20
> "The LORD bless him!" Naomi said to her daughter-in-law. "He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead." She added, "That man is our close relative; he is one of our kinsman-redeemers."
>
> 拿俄米对儿妇说：“愿那人蒙耶和华赐福，因为他不断地恩待活人死人。”拿俄米又说：“那是我们本族的人，是一个至近的亲属。”


得2:21
> Then Ruth the Moabitess said, "He even said to me, 'Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain.'"
>
> 摩押女子路得说：“他对我说：‘你要紧随我的仆人拾取麦穗，直等他们收完了我的庄稼。’”


得2:22
> Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, "It will be good for you, my daughter, to go with his girls, because in someone else's field you might be harmed."
>
> 拿俄米对儿妇路得说：“女儿啊，你跟着他的使女出去，不叫人遇见你在别人田间，这才为好。”


得2:23
> So Ruth stayed close to the servant girls of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
>
> 于是，路得与波阿斯的使女常在一处拾取麦穗，直到收完了大麦和小麦。路得仍与婆婆同住。


## 路得记第3章
得3:1
> One day Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, "My daughter, should I not try to find a home for you, where you will be well provided for?
>
> 路得的婆婆拿俄米对她说：“女儿啊，我不当为你找个安身之处，使你享福吗？


得3:2
> Is not Boaz, with whose servant girls you have been, a kinsman of ours? Tonight he will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor.
>
> 你与波阿斯的使女常在一处，波阿斯不是我们的亲族吗？他今夜在场上簸大麦；


得3:3
> Wash and perfume yourself, and put on your best clothes. Then go down to the threshing floor, but don't let him know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking.
>
> 你要沐浴抹膏，换上衣服，下到场上，却不要使那人认出你来。你等他吃喝完了，


得3:4
> When he lies down, note the place where he is lying. Then go and uncover his feet and lie down. He will tell you what to do."
>
> 到他睡的时候，你看准他睡的地方，就进去掀开他脚上的被，躺卧在那里，他必告诉你所当做的事。”


得3:5
> "I will do whatever you say," Ruth answered.
>
> 路得说：“凡你所吩咐的，我必遵行。”


得3:6
> So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law told her to do.
>
> 路得就下到场上，照她婆婆所吩咐她的而行。


得3:7
> When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he went over to lie down at the far end of the grain pile. Ruth approached quietly, uncovered his feet and lay down.
>
> 波阿斯吃喝完了，心里欢畅，就去睡在麦堆旁边。路得便悄悄地来掀开他脚上的被，躺卧在那里。


得3:8
> In the middle of the night something startled the man, and he turned and discovered a woman lying at his feet.
>
> 到了夜半，那人忽然惊醒，翻过身来，不料，有女子躺在他的脚下。


得3:9
> "Who are you?" he asked. "I am your servant Ruth," she said. "Spread the corner of your garment over me, since you are a kinsman-redeemer."
>
> 他就说：“你是谁？”回答说：“我是你的婢女路得。求你用你的衣襟遮盖我，因为你是我一个至近的亲属。”


得3:10
> "The LORD bless you, my daughter," he replied. "This kindness is greater than that which you showed earlier: You have not run after the younger men, whether rich or poor.
>
> 波阿斯说：“女儿啊，愿你蒙耶和华赐福！你末后的恩，比先前更大，因为少年人无论贫富，你都没有跟从。


得3:11
> And now, my daughter, don't be afraid. I will do for you all you ask. All my fellow townsmen know that you are a woman of noble character.
>
> 女儿啊，现在不要惧怕。凡你所说的，我必照着行，我本城的人都知道你是个贤德的女子。


得3:12
> Although it is true that I am near of kin, there is a kinsman-redeemer nearer than I.
>
> 我实在是你一个至近的亲属，只是还有一个人比我更近。


得3:13
> Stay here for the night, and in the morning if he wants to redeem, good; let him redeem. But if he is not willing, as surely as the LORD lives I will do it. Lie here until morning."
>
> 你今夜在这里住宿，明早他若肯为你尽亲属的本分，就由他吧；倘若不肯，我指着永生的耶和华起誓，我必为你尽了本分，你只管躺到天亮。”


得3:14
> So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before anyone could be recognized; and he said, "Don't let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor."
>
> 路得便在他脚下躺到天快亮，人彼此不能辨认的时候就起来了。波阿斯说：“不可使人知道有女子到场上来。”


得3:15
> He also said, "Bring me the shawl you are wearing and hold it out." When she did so, he poured into it six measures of barley and put it on her. Then he went back to town.
>
> 又对路得说：“打开你所披的外衣。”她打开了，波阿斯就撮了六簸箕大麦，帮她扛在肩上，她便进城去了。


得3:16
> When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, "How did it go, my daughter?" Then she told her everything Boaz had done for her
>
> 路得回到婆婆那里，婆婆说：“女儿啊，怎么样了？”路得就将那人向她所行的述说了一遍。


得3:17
> and added, "He gave me these six measures of barley, saying, 'Don't go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.'"
>
> 又说：“那人给了我六簸箕大麦，对我说：‘你不可空手回去见你的婆婆。’”


得3:18
> Then Naomi said, "Wait, my daughter, until you find out what happens. For the man will not rest until the matter is settled today."
>
> 婆婆说：“女儿啊，你只管安坐等候，看这事怎样成就，因为那人今日不办成这事必不休息。”


## 路得记第4章
得4:1
> Meanwhile Boaz went up to the town gate and sat there. When the kinsman-redeemer he had mentioned came along, Boaz said, "Come over here, my friend, and sit down." So he went over and sat down.
>
> 波阿斯到了城门，坐在那里，恰巧波阿斯所说的那至近的亲属经过。波阿斯说：“某人哪，你来坐在这里。”他就来坐下。


得4:2
> Boaz took ten of the elders of the town and said, "Sit here," and they did so.
>
> 波阿斯又从本城的长老中拣选了十人，对他们说：“请你们坐在这里。”他们就都坐下。


得4:3
> Then he said to the kinsman-redeemer, "Naomi, who has come back from Moab, is selling the piece of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech.
>
> 波阿斯对那至近的亲属说：“从摩押地回来的拿俄米，现在要卖我们族兄以利米勒的那块地。


得4:4
> I thought I should bring the matter to your attention and suggest that you buy it in the presence of these seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, do so. But if you will not, tell me, so I will know. For no one has the right to do it except you, and I am next in line." "I will redeem it," he said.
>
> 我想当赎那块地的是你，其次是我，以外再没有别人了。你可以在这里的人面前和我本国的长老面前说明，你若肯赎就赎，若不肯赎就告诉我。”那人回答说：“我肯赎。”


得4:5
> Then Boaz said, "On the day you buy the land from Naomi and from Ruth the Moabitess, you acquire the dead man's widow, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property."
>
> 波阿斯说：“你从拿俄米手中买这地的时候，也当娶（原文作“买”，十节同）死人的妻摩押女子路得，使死人在产业上存留他的名。”


得4:6
> At this, the kinsman-redeemer said, "Then I cannot redeem it because I might endanger my own estate. You redeem it yourself. I cannot do it."
>
> 那人说：“这样我就不能赎了，恐怕于我的产业有碍。你可以赎我所当赎的，我不能赎了。”


得4:7
> (Now in earlier times in Israel, for the redemption and transfer of property to become final, one party took off his sandal and gave it to the other. This was the method of legalizing transactions in Israel.)
>
> 从前，在以色列中要定夺什么事，或赎回或交易，这人就脱鞋给那人。以色列人都以此为证据。


得4:8
> So the kinsman-redeemer said to Boaz, "Buy it yourself." And he removed his sandal.
>
> 那人对波阿斯说：“你自己买吧！”于是将鞋脱下来了。


得4:9
> Then Boaz announced to the elders and all the people, "Today you are witnesses that I have bought from Naomi all the property of Elimelech, Kilion and Mahlon.
>
> 波阿斯对长老和众民说：“你们今日作见证，凡属以利米勒和基连、玛伦的，我都从拿俄米手中置买了，


得4:10
> I have also acquired Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon's widow, as my wife, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property, so that his name will not disappear from among his family or from the town records. Today you are witnesses!"
>
> 又娶了玛伦的妻摩押女子路得为妻，好在死人的产业上存留他的名，免得他的名在本族本乡灭没。你们今日可以作见证。”


得4:11
> Then the elders and all those at the gate said, "We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you have standing in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem.
>
> 在城门坐着的众民和长老都说：“我们作见证。愿耶和华使进你家的这女子，像建立以色列家的拉结、利亚二人一样。又愿你在以法他得亨通，在伯利恒得名声。


得4:12
> Through the offspring the LORD gives you by this young woman, may your family be like that of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah."
>
> 愿耶和华从这少年女子赐你后裔，使你的家像她玛从犹大所生法勒斯的家一般。”


得4:13
> So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. Then he went to her, and the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son.
>
> 于是，波阿斯娶了路得为妻，与她同房，耶和华使她怀孕，生了一个儿子。


得4:14
> The women said to Naomi: "Praise be to the LORD, who this day has not left you without a kinsman-redeemer. May he become famous throughout Israel!
>
> 妇人们对拿俄米说：“耶和华是应当称颂的！因为今日没有撇下你，使你无至近的亲属。愿这孩子在以色列中得名声。


得4:15
> He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and who is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth."
>
> 他必提起你的精　神，奉养你的老，因为是爱慕你的那儿妇所生的。有这儿妇比有七个儿子还好！”


得4:16
> Then Naomi took the child, laid him in her lap and cared for him.
>
> 拿俄米就把孩子抱在怀中，作他的养母。


得4:17
> The women living there said, "Naomi has a son." And they named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.
>
> 邻舍的妇人说：“拿俄米得孩子了。”就给孩子起名叫俄备得。这俄备得是耶西的父，耶西是大卫的父。


得4:18
> This, then, is the family line of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron,
>
> 法勒斯的后代记在下面：法勒斯生希斯仑，


得4:19
> Hezron the father of Ram, Ram the father of Amminadab,
>
> 希斯仑生兰，兰生亚米拿达，


得4:20
> Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon,
>
> 亚米拿达生拿顺，拿顺生撒门，


得4:21
> Salmon the father of Boaz, Boaz the father of Obed,
>
> 撒门生波阿斯，波阿斯生俄备得，


得4:22
> Obed the father of Jesse, and Jesse the father of David.
>
> 俄备得生耶西，耶西生大卫。
