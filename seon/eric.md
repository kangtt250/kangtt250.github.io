# Eric’s Note (About This Book)

埃里克的笔记(关于这本书)

Throughout his career, Naval has generously shared his wisdom, and millions of people around the world follow his advice on building wealth and living happily.

在他的整个职业生涯中，纳瓦尔慷慨地分享了他的智慧，世界各地数百万人听从了他关于积累财富和幸福生活的建议。

Naval Ravikant is an icon in Silicon Valley and startup culture around the world. He founded multiple successful companies (Epinions during the 2000 dot -com crash, AngelList in 2010). Naval is also an angel investor, betting early on companies like Uber, Twitter, Postmates, and hundreds more.

Naval Ravikant是硅谷的偶像，也是世界各地的创业文化。他创立了多家成功的公司(2000年互联网崩盘时的Epinions，2010年的AngelList)。纳瓦尔也是一位天使投资者，很早就押注于优步(Uber)、Twitter、Postmate等数百家公司。

More than a financial success, Naval has been sharing his own philosophy of life and happiness, attracting readers and listeners throughout the world. Naval is broadly followed because he is a rare combination of successful and happy. After a lifetime of study and application of philosophy, economics, and wealth creation, he has proven the impact of his principles.

除了经济上的成功，纳瓦尔还分享了他自己的人生和幸福哲学，吸引了世界各地的读者和听众。纳瓦尔受到广泛关注，因为他是成功和快乐的罕见组合。经过毕生对哲学、经济学和财富创造的研究和应用，他证明了他的原则的影响力。

Today, Naval continues to build and invest in companies almost casually, in his own artistic way, while maintaining a healthy, peaceful, and balanced life. This book collects and organizes the pieces of wisdom he has shared and shows you how to achieve the same for yourself.

今天，纳瓦尔继续以他自己的艺术方式几乎随意地建立和投资公司，同时保持健康、和平和平衡的生活。这本书收集并整理了他分享的智慧，并向你展示了如何为自己实现同样的目标。

Naval’s life story is instructive. An introspective founder, self -taught investor, capitalist, and engineer certainly has something to teach us all.

纳瓦尔的生平故事很有启发性。一位自省的创始人、自学成才的投资者、资本家和工程师肯定有东西可以教给我们所有人。

As a first -principles thinker with no fear of speaking his truth, Naval’s thoughts are often unique and thought -provoking . His instinct for seeing through life’s veneer has changed how I see the world.

作为一个不怕说真话的第一原则思想家，纳瓦尔的思想常常是独一无二的，发人深省。他看穿生活表象的本能改变了我看待世界的方式。

I’ve learned an enormous amount from Naval. Reading, listening, and applying his principles of wealth and happiness has given me calm confidence on my path and taught me to enjoy every moment of this journey. Closely studying his career has shown me how great things are accomplished through small, persistent steps, and how large an impact one individual can have.

我从纳瓦尔那里学到了很多。阅读、倾听和应用他的财富和幸福原则，给了我在道路上平静的信心，并教会了我享受这段旅程的每一刻。仔细研究他的职业生涯让我看到，伟大的事情是如何通过小小的、坚持不懈的步骤完成的，以及一个人能产生多大的影响。

I refer to his work often and recommend it to friends. Those conversations inspired me to create this book, so people can learn from his perspective whether they’re new to Naval’s ideas or have followed him the past ten years.

我经常参考他的作品，并把它推荐给朋友。这些对话激发了我创作这本书的灵感，这样人们就可以从他的角度了解到，无论他们是对纳瓦尔的想法是新的，还是在过去的十年里一直关注他。

This book collects the wisdom shared by Naval over the past decade in his own words through Twitter, blog posts, and podcasts. With this book, you can get the benefits of a lifetime in a few hours.

这本书通过推特、博客帖子和播客收集了纳瓦尔在过去十年中分享的智慧，用他自己的话说。有了这本书，你可以在几个小时内得到一生的好处。

I created this book as a public service. Tweets, podcasts, and interviews quickly get buried and lost. Knowledge this valuable deserves a more permanent, accessible format. That is my mission with this book.

我创作这本书是作为一项公共服务。推特、播客和采访很快就会被淹没和丢失。这种有价值的知识应该有一种更持久、更容易获得的形式。这就是我写这本书的使命。

I hope this acts as an introduction to Naval’s ideas. I’ve collected his most powerful and useful ideas in his own words, woven them into a readable thread, and organized those into sections for easy reference.

我希望这能作为对纳瓦尔思想的介绍。我用他自己的话收集了他最有力和最有用的想法，将它们编织成一条可读的线索，并将它们组织成几个部分，以便于参考。

I often find myself reviewing sections of this book before making an investment or opening to the Happiness chapter if I’m feeling off. Creating this book has changed me. I feel more clarity, confidence, and peace through all aspects of life. I hope reading it will do the same for you.

我经常发现自己在进行投资之前会复习这本书的几个章节，如果我感觉不舒服的话，就会打开“幸福”一章。创作这本书改变了我。我在生活的方方面面都感受到了更清晰、更自信、更平和。我希望读一读它也会对你有同样的帮助。

The Almanack is intended as a guide to be read and consulted for specific topics. If Naval doesn’t answer your emails, I hope this book gives you the next -best advice.

年鉴旨在作为特定主题的阅读和参考指南。如果纳瓦尔不回复你的电子邮件，我希望这本书能给你下一个最好的建议。

This book is an introduction to Naval and dives deeply into his two most -explored topics: wealth and happiness. If you want to continue exploring Naval and his other ideas, I encourage you to check out the “Next on Naval” section at the end of this book. I’ve shared chapters that were edited out of the final book, as well as other popular resources.

这本书是对纳瓦尔的介绍，深入探讨了他探索最多的两个主题：财富和幸福。如果你想继续探索纳瓦尔和他的其他想法，我建议你看看本书末尾的“纳瓦尔的下一步”部分。我已经分享了最后一本书中被编辑掉的章节，以及其他受欢迎的资源。

Be well,

好好保重，
