## 约书亚记第1章
书1:1
> After the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, the LORD said to Joshua son of Nun, Moses' aide:
>
> 耶和华的仆人摩西死了以后，耶和华晓谕摩西的帮手、嫩的儿子约书亚说：


书1:2
> "Moses my servant is dead. Now then, you and all these people, get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give to them--to the Israelites.
>
> “我的仆人摩西死了。现在你要起来，和众百姓过这约旦河，往我所要赐给以色列人的地去。


书1:3
> I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses.
>
> 凡你们脚掌所踏之地，我都照着我所应许摩西的话赐给你们了。


书1:4
> Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the great river, the Euphrates--all the Hittite country--to the Great Sea on the west.
>
> 从旷野和这黎巴嫩，直到伯拉大河，赫人的全地，又到大海日落之处，都要作你们的境界。


书1:5
> No one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you.
>
> 你平生的日子，必无一人能在你面前站立得住。我怎样与摩西同在，也必照样与你同在；我必不撇下你，也不丢弃你。


书1:6
> "Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their forefathers to give them.
>
> “你当刚强壮胆！因为你必使这百姓承受那地为业，就是我向他们列祖起誓应许赐给他们的地。


书1:7
> Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go.
>
> 只要刚强，大大壮胆，谨守遵行我仆人摩西所吩咐你的一切律法，不可偏离左右，使你无论往哪里去，都可以顺利。


书1:8
> Do not let this Book of the Law depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.
>
> 这律法书不可离开你的口，总要昼夜思想，好使你谨守遵行这书上所写的一切话。如此，你的道路就可以亨通，凡事顺利。


书1:9
> Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go."
>
> 我岂没有吩咐你吗？你当刚强壮胆！不要惧怕，也不要惊惶，因为你无论往哪里去，耶和华你的　神必与你同在。”


书1:10
> So Joshua ordered the officers of the people:
>
> 于是，约书亚吩咐百姓的官长说：


书1:11
> "Go through the camp and tell the people, 'Get your supplies ready. Three days from now you will cross the Jordan here to go in and take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving you for your own.'"
>
> “你们要走遍营中，吩咐百姓说：‘当预备食物；因为三日之内，你们要过这约旦河，进去得耶和华你们　神赐你们为业之地。’”


书1:12
> But to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,
>
> 约书亚对流便人、迦得人和玛拿西半支派的人说：


书1:13
> "Remember the command that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you: 'The LORD your God is giving you rest and has granted you this land.'
>
> “你们要追念耶和华的仆人摩西所吩咐你们的话说：‘耶和华你们的　神使你们得享平安，也必将这地赐给你们’。


书1:14
> Your wives, your children and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan, but all your fighting men, fully armed, must cross over ahead of your brothers. You are to help your brothers
>
> 你们的妻子、孩子和牲畜都可以留在约旦河东摩西所给你们的地；但你们中间一切大能的勇士都要带着兵器，在你们的弟兄前面过去，帮助他们。


书1:15
> until the LORD gives them rest, as he has done for you, and until they too have taken possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving them. After that, you may go back and occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you east of the Jordan toward the sunrise."
>
> 等到耶和华使你们的弟兄像你们一样得享平安，并且得着耶和华你们　神所赐他们为业之地，那时才可以回你们所得之地，承受为业，就是耶和华的仆人摩西在约旦河东、向日出之地所给你们的。”


书1:16
> Then they answered Joshua, "Whatever you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
>
> 他们回答约书亚说：“你所吩咐我们行的，我们都必行；你所差遣我们去的，我们都必去。


书1:17
> Just as we fully obeyed Moses, so we will obey you. Only may the LORD your God be with you as he was with Moses.
>
> 我们从前在一切事上怎样听从摩西，现在也必照样听从你；惟愿耶和华你的　神与你同在，像与摩西同在一样。


书1:18
> Whoever rebels against your word and does not obey your words, whatever you may command them, will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous!"
>
> 无论什么人违背你的命令，不听从你所吩咐他的一切话，就必治死他。你只要刚强壮胆！”


## 约书亚记第2章
书2:1
> Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Shittim. "Go, look over the land," he said, "especially Jericho." So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there.
>
> 当下，嫩的儿子约书亚从什亭暗暗打发两个人作探子，吩咐说：“你们去窥探那地和耶利哥。”于是二人去了，来到一个妓女名叫喇合的家里，就在那里躺卧。


书2:2
> The king of Jericho was told, "Look! Some of the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land."
>
> 有人告诉耶利哥王说：“今夜有以色列人来到这里窥探此地。”


书2:3
> So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab: "Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, because they have come to spy out the whole land."
>
> 耶利哥王打发人去见喇合说：“那来到你这里、进了你家的人要交出来，因为他们来窥探全地。”


书2:4
> But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. She said, "Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they had come from.
>
> 女人将二人隐藏，就回答说：“那人果然到我这里来，他们是哪里来的我却不知道。


书2:5
> At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, the men left. I don't know which way they went. Go after them quickly. You may catch up with them."
>
> 天黑、要关城门的时候，他们出去了，往哪里去我却不知道。你们快快地去追赶，就必追上。”


书2:6
> (But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax she had laid out on the roof.)
>
> （先是女人领二人上了房顶，将他们藏在那里所摆的麻秸中。）


书2:7
> So the men set out in pursuit of the spies on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.
>
> 那些人就往约旦河的渡口追赶他们去了。追赶他们的人一出去，城门就关了。


书2:8
> Before the spies lay down for the night, she went up on the roof
>
> 二人还没有躺卧，女人就上房顶，到他们那里，


书2:9
> and said to them, "I know that the LORD has given this land to you and that a great fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you.
>
> 对他们说：“我知道耶和华已经把这地赐给你们，并且因你们的缘故我们都惊慌了。这地的一切居民在你们面前心都消化了，


书2:10
> We have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan, whom you completely destroyed.
>
> 因为我们听见你们出埃及的时候，耶和华怎样在你们前面使红海的水干了，并且你们怎样待约旦河东的两个亚摩利王西宏和噩，将他们尽行毁灭。


书2:11
> When we heard of it, our hearts melted and everyone's courage failed because of you, for the LORD your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below.
>
> 我们一听见这些事，心就消化了。因你们的缘故，并无一人有胆气。耶和华你们的　神，本是上天下地的　神。


书2:12
> Now then, please swear to me by the LORD that you will show kindness to my family, because I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign
>
> 现在我既是恩待你们，求你们指着耶和华向我起誓，也要恩待我父家，并给我一个实在的证据，


书2:13
> that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and that you will save us from death."
>
> 要救活我的父母、弟兄、姐妹和一切属他们的，拯救我们性命不死。”


书2:14
> "Our lives for your lives!" the men assured her. "If you don't tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the LORD gives us the land."
>
> 二人对她说：“你若不泄漏我们这件事，我们情愿替你们死。耶和华将这地赐给我们的时候，我们必以慈爱诚实待你。”


书2:15
> So she let them down by a rope through the window, for the house she lived in was part of the city wall.
>
> 于是，女人用绳子将二人从窗户里缒下去，因她的房子是在城墙边上，她也住在城墙上。


书2:16
> Now she had said to them, "Go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there three days until they return, and then go on your way."
>
> 她对他们说：“你们且往山上去，恐怕追赶的人碰见你们。要在那里隐藏三天，等追赶的人回来，然后才可以走你们的路。”


书2:17
> The men said to her, "This oath you made us swear will not be binding on us
>
> 二人对她说：“你要这样行。不然，你叫我们所起的誓就与我们无干了。


书2:18
> unless, when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you have brought your father and mother, your brothers and all your family into your house.
>
> 我们来到这地的时候，你要把这条朱红线绳系在缒我们下去的窗户上，并要使你的父母、弟兄和你父的全家都聚集在你家中。


书2:19
> If anyone goes outside your house into the street, his blood will be on his own head; we will not be responsible. As for anyone who is in the house with you, his blood will be on our head if a hand is laid on him.
>
> 凡出了你家门往街上去的，他的罪（原文作“血”）必归到自己的头上，与我们无干了。凡在你家里的，若有人下手害他，流他血的罪就归到我们的头上。


书2:20
> But if you tell what we are doing, we will be released from the oath you made us swear."
>
> 你若泄漏我们这件事，你叫我们所起的誓就与我们无干了。”


书2:21
> "Agreed," she replied. "Let it be as you say." So she sent them away and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window.
>
> 女人说：“照你们的话行吧！”于是打发他们去了，又把朱红线绳系在窗户上。


书2:22
> When they left, they went into the hills and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned without finding them.
>
> 二人到山上，在那里住了三天，等着追赶的人回去了。追赶的人一路找他们，却找不着。


书2:23
> Then the two men started back. They went down out of the hills, forded the river and came to Joshua son of Nun and told him everything that had happened to them.
>
> 二人就下山回来，过了河，到嫩的儿子约书亚那里，向他述说所遭遇的一切事。


书2:24
> They said to Joshua, "The LORD has surely given the whole land into our hands; all the people are melting in fear because of us."
>
> 又对约书亚说：“耶和华果然将那全地交在我们手中，那地的一切居民在我们面前心都消化了。”


## 约书亚记第3章
书3:1
> Early in the morning Joshua and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and went to the Jordan, where they camped before crossing over.
>
> 约书亚清早起来，和以色列众人都离开什亭，来到约旦河，就住在那里，等候过河。


书3:2
> After three days the officers went throughout the camp,
>
> 过了三天，官长走遍营中，


书3:3
> giving orders to the people: "When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests, who are Levites, carrying it, you are to move out from your positions and follow it.
>
> 吩咐百姓说：“你们看见耶和华你们　神的约柜，又见祭司利未人抬着，就要离开所住的地方，跟着约柜去。


书3:4
> Then you will know which way to go, since you have never been this way before. But keep a distance of about a thousand yards between you and the ark; do not go near it."
>
> 只是你们和约柜相离，要量二千肘，不可与约柜相近，使你们知道所当走的路，因为这条路你们向来没有走过。”


书3:5
> Joshua told the people, "Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do amazing things among you."
>
> 约书亚吩咐百姓说：“你们要自洁，因为明天耶和华必在你们中间行奇事。”


书3:6
> Joshua said to the priests, "Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on ahead of the people." So they took it up and went ahead of them.
>
> 约书亚又吩咐祭司说：“你们抬起约柜，在百姓前头过去。”于是他们抬起约柜，在百姓前头走。


书3:7
> And the LORD said to Joshua, "Today I will begin to exalt you in the eyes of all Israel, so they may know that I am with you as I was with Moses.
>
> 耶和华对约书亚说：“从今日起，我必使你在以色列众人眼前尊大，使他们知道我怎样与摩西同在，也必照样与你同在。


书3:8
> Tell the priests who carry the ark of the covenant: 'When you reach the edge of the Jordan's waters, go and stand in the river.'"
>
> 你要吩咐抬约柜的祭司说：‘你们到了约旦河的水边上，就要在约旦河水里站住。’”


书3:9
> Joshua said to the Israelites, "Come here and listen to the words of the LORD your God.
>
> 约书亚对以色列人说：“你们近前来，听耶和华你们　神的话。”


书3:10
> This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that he will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites and Jebusites.
>
> 约书亚说：“看哪！普天下主的约柜必在你们前头过去，到约旦河里，因此你们就知道在你们中间有永生　神。


书3:11
> See, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go into the Jordan ahead of you.
>
> 并且他必在你们面前赶出迦南人，赫人，希未人，比利洗人，革迦撒人，亚摩利人，耶布斯人。


书3:12
> Now then, choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.
>
> 你们现在要从以色列支派中拣选十二个人，每支派一人，


书3:13
> And as soon as the priests who carry the ark of the LORD--the Lord of all the earth--set foot in the Jordan, its waters flowing downstream will be cut off and stand up in a heap."
>
> 等到抬普天下主耶和华约柜的祭司把脚站在约旦河水里，约旦河的水，就是从上往下流的水，必然断绝，立起成垒。”


书3:14
> So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them.
>
> 百姓离开帐棚，要过约旦河的时候，抬约柜的祭司乃在百姓的前头。


书3:15
> Now the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest. Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water's edge,
>
> 他们到了约旦河，脚一入水（原来约旦河水在收割的日子涨过两岸），


书3:16
> the water from upstream stopped flowing. It piled up in a heap a great distance away, at a town called Adam in the vicinity of Zarethan, while the water flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.
>
> 那从上往下流的水，便在极远之地、撒拉但旁的亚当城那里停住，立起成垒；那往亚拉巴的海，就是盐海下流的水全然断绝。于是，百姓在耶利哥的对面过去了。


书3:17
> The priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, while all Israel passed by until the whole nation had completed the crossing on dry ground.
>
> 抬耶和华约柜的祭司在约旦河中的干地上站定，以色列众人都从乾地上过去，直到国民尽都过了约旦河。


## 约书亚记第4章
书4:1
> When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua,
>
> 国民尽都过了约旦河，耶和华就对约书亚说：


书4:2
> "Choose twelve men from among the people, one from each tribe,
>
> “你从民中要拣选十二个人，每支派一人，


书4:3
> and tell them to take up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan from right where the priests stood and to carry them over with you and put them down at the place where you stay tonight."
>
> 吩咐他们说：‘你们从这里，从约旦河中、祭司脚站定的地方，取十二块石头带过去，放在你们今夜要住宿的地方。’”


书4:4
> So Joshua called together the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe,
>
> 于是，约书亚将他从以色列人中所预备的那十二个人，每支派一人，都召了来，


书4:5
> and said to them, "Go over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan. Each of you is to take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites,
>
> 对他们说：“你们下约旦河中，过到耶和华你们　神的约柜前头，按着以色列人十二支派的数目，每人取一块石头扛在肩上。


书4:6
> to serve as a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask you, 'What do these stones mean?'
>
> 这些石头在你们中间可以作为证据。日后你们的子孙问你们说：‘这些石头是什么意思？’


书4:7
> tell them that the flow of the Jordan was cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones are to be a memorial to the people of Israel forever."
>
> 你们就对他们说：‘这是因为约旦河的水在耶和华的约柜前断绝；约柜过约旦河的时候，约旦河的水就断绝了。这些石头要作以色列人永远的记念。’”


书4:8
> So the Israelites did as Joshua commanded them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, as the LORD had told Joshua; and they carried them over with them to their camp, where they put them down.
>
> 以色列人就照约书亚所吩咐的，按着以色列人支派的数目，从约旦河中取了十二块石头，都遵耶和华所吩咐约书亚的行了。他们把石头带过去，到他们所住宿的地方，就放在那里。


书4:9
> Joshua set up the twelve stones that had been in the middle of the Jordan at the spot where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant had stood. And they are there to this day.
>
> 约书亚另把十二块石头立在约旦河中，在抬约柜的祭司脚站立的地方；直到今日，那石头还在那里。


书4:10
> Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything the LORD had commanded Joshua was done by the people, just as Moses had directed Joshua. The people hurried over,
>
> 抬约柜的祭司站在约旦河中，等到耶和华晓谕约书亚吩咐百姓的事办完了，是照摩西所吩咐约书亚的一切话。于是，百姓急速过去了。


书4:11
> and as soon as all of them had crossed, the ark of the LORD and the priests came to the other side while the people watched.
>
> 众百姓尽都过了河，耶和华的约柜和祭司就在百姓面前过去。


书4:12
> The men of Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over, armed, in front of the Israelites, as Moses had directed them.
>
> 流便人、迦得人、玛拿西半支派的人，都照摩西所吩咐他们的，带着兵器在以色列人前头过去。


书4:13
> About forty thousand armed for battle crossed over before the LORD to the plains of Jericho for war.
>
> 约有四万人都准备打仗，在耶和华面前过去，到耶利哥的平原，等候上阵。


书4:14
> That day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they revered him all the days of his life, just as they had revered Moses.
>
> 当那日，耶和华使约书亚在以色列众人眼前尊大，在他平生的日子，百姓敬畏他，像从前敬畏摩西一样。


书4:15
> Then the LORD said to Joshua,
>
> 耶和华晓谕约书亚说：


书4:16
> "Command the priests carrying the ark of the Testimony to come up out of the Jordan."
>
> “你吩咐抬法柜的祭司从约旦河里上来。”


书4:17
> So Joshua commanded the priests, "Come up out of the Jordan."
>
> 约书亚就吩咐祭司说：“你们从约旦河里上来。”


书4:18
> And the priests came up out of the river carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD. No sooner had they set their feet on the dry ground than the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and ran at flood stage as before.
>
> 抬耶和华约柜的祭司从约旦河里上来，脚掌刚落旱地，约旦河的水就流到原处，仍旧涨过两岸。


书4:19
> On the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho.
>
> 正月初十日，百姓从约旦河里上来，就在吉甲，在耶利哥的东边安营。


书4:20
> And Joshua set up at Gilgal the twelve stones they had taken out of the Jordan.
>
> 他们从约旦河中取来的那十二块石头，约书亚就立在吉甲，


书4:21
> He said to the Israelites, "In the future when your descendants ask their fathers, 'What do these stones mean?'
>
> 对以色列人说：“日后你们的子孙问他们的父亲说：‘这些石头是什么意思？’


书4:22
> tell them, 'Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.'
>
> 你们就告诉他们说：‘以色列人曾走干地过这约旦河。’


书4:23
> For the LORD your God dried up the Jordan before you until you had crossed over. The LORD your God did to the Jordan just what he had done to the Red Sea when he dried it up before us until we had crossed over.
>
> 因为耶和华你们的　神在你们前面使约旦河的水干了，等着你们过来，就如耶和华你们的　神从前在我们前面使红海乾了，等着我们过来一样，


书4:24
> He did this so that all the peoples of the earth might know that the hand of the LORD is powerful and so that you might always fear the LORD your God."
>
> 要使地上万民都知道，耶和华的手大有能力，也要使你们永远敬畏耶和华你们的　神。”


## 约书亚记第5章
书5:1
> Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast heard how the LORD had dried up the Jordan before the Israelites until we had crossed over, their hearts melted and they no longer had the courage to face the Israelites.
>
> 约旦河西亚摩利人的诸王和靠海迦南人的诸王，听见耶和华在以色列人前面使约旦河的水干了，等到我们过去，他们的心因以色列人的缘故就消化了，不再有胆气。


书5:2
> At that time the LORD said to Joshua, "Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites again."
>
> 那时，耶和华吩咐约书亚说：“你制造火石刀，第二次给以色列人行割礼。”


书5:3
> So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath Haaraloth.
>
> 约书亚就制造了火石刀，在除皮山那里给以色列人行割礼。


书5:4
> Now this is why he did so: All those who came out of Egypt--all the men of military age--died in the desert on the way after leaving Egypt.
>
> 约书亚行割礼的缘故，是因为从埃及出来的众民，就是一切能打仗的男丁，出了埃及以后，都死在旷野的路上。


书5:5
> All the people that came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the desert during the journey from Egypt had not.
>
> 因为出来的众民都受过割礼，惟独出埃及以后，在旷野的路上所生的众民，都没有受过割礼。


书5:6
> The Israelites had moved about in the desert forty years until all the men who were of military age when they left Egypt had died, since they had not obeyed the LORD. For the LORD had sworn to them that they would not see the land that he had solemnly promised their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
>
> 以色列人在旷野走了四十年，等到国民，就是出埃及的兵丁，都消灭了，因为他们没有听从耶和华的话。耶和华曾向他们起誓，必不容他们看见耶和华向他们列祖起誓应许赐给我们的地，就是流奶与蜜之地。


书5:7
> So he raised up their sons in their place, and these were the ones Joshua circumcised. They were still uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised on the way.
>
> 他们的子孙，就是耶和华所兴起来接续他们的，都没有受过割礼；因为在路上没有给他们行割礼，约书亚这才给他们行了。


书5:8
> And after the whole nation had been circumcised, they remained where they were in camp until they were healed.
>
> 国民都受完了割礼，就住在营中自己的地方，等到痊愈了。


书5:9
> Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you." So the place has been called Gilgal to this day.
>
> 耶和华对约书亚说：“我今日将埃及的羞辱从你们身上滚去了。”因此，那地方名叫吉甲（就是“滚”的意思），直到今日。


书5:10
> On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, while camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, the Israelites celebrated the Passover.
>
> 以色列人在吉甲安营。正月十四日晚上，在耶利哥的平原守逾越节。


书5:11
> The day after the Passover, that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land: unleavened bread and roasted grain.
>
> 逾越节的次日，他们就吃了那地的出产；正当那日，吃无酵饼和烘的谷。


书5:12
> The manna stopped the day after they ate this food from the land; there was no longer any manna for the Israelites, but that year they ate of the produce of Canaan.
>
> 他们吃了那地的出产，第二日吗哪就止住了，以色列人也不再有吗哪了。那一年，他们却吃迦南地的出产。


书5:13
> Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went up to him and asked, "Are you for us or for our enemies?"
>
> 约书亚靠近耶利哥的时候，举目观看，不料，有一个人手里有拔出来的刀，对面站立。约书亚到他那里，问他说：“你是帮助我们呢？是帮助我们敌人呢？”


书5:14
> "Neither," he replied, "but as commander of the army of the LORD I have now come." Then Joshua fell facedown to the ground in reverence, and asked him, "What message does my Lord have for his servant?"
>
> 他回答说：“不是的，我来是要作耶和华军队的元帅。”约书亚就俯伏在地下拜，说：“我主有什么话吩咐仆人？”


书5:15
> The commander of the LORD'S army replied, "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy." And Joshua did so.
>
> 耶和华军队的元帅对约书亚说：“把你脚上的鞋脱下来，因为你所站的地方是圣的。”约书亚就照着行了。


## 约书亚记第6章
书6:1
> Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the Israelites. No one went out and no one came in.
>
> 耶利哥的城门因以色列人就关得严紧，无人出入。


书6:2

## 约书亚记第7章
书7:1

>
> 以色列人在当灭的物上犯了罪，因为犹大支派中，谢拉的曾孙、撒底的孙子、迦米的儿子亚干取了当灭的物，耶和华的怒气就向以色列人发作。

>
> 他们回到约书亚那里，对他说：“众民不必都上去，只要二三千人上去，就能攻取艾城；不必劳累众民都去，因为那里的人少。”


书7:4
> So about three thousand men went up; but they were routed by the men of Ai,
>
> 于是，民中约有三千人上那里去，竟在艾城人面前逃跑了。


书7:5
> who killed about thirty-six of them. They chased the Israelites from the city gate as far as the stone quarries and struck them down on the slopes. At this the hearts of the people melted and became like water.
>
> 艾城的人击杀了他们三十六人，从城门前追赶他们，直到示巴琳，在下坡杀败他们。众民的心就消化如水。

>
> 约书亚便撕裂衣服，他和以色列的长老把灰撒在头上，在耶和华的约柜前俯伏在地，直到晚上。

>
> 主啊，以色列人既在仇敌面前转背逃跑，我还有什么可说的呢？


书7:9
> The Canaanites and the other people of the country will hear about this and they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. What then will you do for your own great name?"
>
> 迦南人和这地一切的居民听见了，就必围困我们，将我们的名从地上除灭。那时，你为你的大名要怎样行呢？”


书7:10
> The LORD said to Joshua, "Stand up! What are you doing down on your face?
>
> 耶和华吩咐约书亚说：“起来！你为何这样俯伏在地呢？


书7:11
> Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenant, which I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have lied, they have put them with their own possessions.
>
> 以色列人犯了罪，违背了我所吩咐他们的约，取了当灭的物，又偷窃，又行诡诈，又把那当灭的放在他们的家具里。


书7:12
> That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies; they turn their backs and run because they have been made liable to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy whatever among you is devoted to destruction.
>
> 因此，以色列人在仇敌面前站立不住。他们在仇敌面前转背逃跑，是因成了被咒诅的，你们若不把当灭的物从你们中间除掉，我就不再与你们同在了。


书7:13
> "Go, consecrate the people. Tell them, 'Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow; for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: That which is devoted is among you, O Israel. You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove it.
>
> 你起来，叫百姓自洁，对他们说：‘你们要自洁，预备明天，因为耶和华以色列的　神这样说：以色列啊，你们中间有当灭的物。你们若不除掉，在仇敌面前必站立不住。’


书7:14
> "'In the morning, present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe that the LORD takes shall come forward clan by clan; the clan that the LORD takes shall come forward family by family; and the family that the LORD takes shall come forward man by man.
>
> 到了早晨，你们要按着支派近前来；耶和华所取的支派，要按着宗族近前来；耶和华所取的宗族，要按着家室近前来；耶和华所取的家室，要按着人丁，一个一个地近前来。


书7:15

>
> 约书亚对亚干说：“我儿，我劝你将荣耀归给耶和华以色列的　神，在他面前认罪，将你所做的事告诉我，不要向我隐瞒。”


书7:20
> Achan replied, "It is true! I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel. This is what I have done:
>
> 亚干回答约书亚说：“我实在得罪了耶和华以色列的　神。我所做的事如此如此：


书7:21
> When I saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia, two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath."
>
> 我在所夺的财物中，看见一件美好的示拿衣服、二百舍客勒银子、一条金子重五十舍客勒，我就贪爱这些物件，便拿去了。现今藏在我帐棚内的地里，银子在衣服底下。”


书7:22
> So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath.
>
> 约书亚就打发人跑到亚干的帐棚里。那件衣服果然藏在他帐棚内，银子在底下。


书7:23
> They took the things from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and spread them out before the LORD.
>
> 他们就从帐棚里取出来，拿到约书亚和以色列众人那里，放在耶和华面前。


书7:24
> Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the gold wedge, his sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys and sheep, his tent and all that he had, to the Valley of Achor.
>
> 约书亚和以色列众人把谢拉的曾孙亚干和那银子、那件衣服、那条金子，并亚干的儿女、牛、驴、羊、帐棚，以及他所有的，都带到亚割谷去。


书7:25
> Joshua said, "Why have you brought this trouble on us? The LORD will bring trouble on you today." Then all Israel stoned him, and after they had stoned the rest, they burned them.
>
> 约书亚说：“你为什么连累我们呢？今日耶和华必叫你受连累。”于是，以色列众人用石头打死他，将石头扔在其上，又用火焚烧他所有的（“他所有的”原文作“他们”）。


书7:26
> Over Achan they heaped up a large pile of rocks, which remains to this day. Then the LORD turned from his fierce anger. Therefore that place has been called the Valley of Achor ever since.
>
> 众人在亚干身上堆成一大堆石头，直存到今日。于是，耶和华转意，不发他的烈怒。因此那地方名叫亚割谷（“亚割”就是“连累”的意思），直到今日。

> Now Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Ai and totally destroyed it, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and that the people of Gibeon had made a treaty of peace with Israel and were living near them.
>
> 耶路撒冷王亚多尼洗德听见约书亚夺了艾城，尽行毁灭，怎样待耶利哥和耶利哥的王，也照样待艾城和艾城的王，又听见基遍的居民与以色列人立了和约，住在他们中间，


书10:2
> He and his people were very much alarmed at this, because Gibeon was an important city, like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were good fighters.
>
> 就甚惧怕。因为基遍是一座大城，如都城一般，比艾城更大，并且城内的人都是勇士。


书10:3
> So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem appealed to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish and Debir king of Eglon.
>
> 所以耶路撒冷王亚多尼洗德打发人去见希伯仑王何咸、耶末王毗兰、拉吉王雅非亚和伊矶伦王底璧，说：


书10:4
> "Come up and help me attack Gibeon," he said, "because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites."
>
> “求你们上来帮助我，我们好攻打基遍，因为他们与约书亚和以色列人立了和约。”

>
> 于是，五个亚摩利王，就是耶路撒冷王、希伯仑王、耶末王、拉吉王、伊矶伦王，大家聚集，率领他们的众军上去，对着基遍安营，攻打基遍。


书10:6
> The Gibeonites then sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: "Do not abandon your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, because all the Amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us."
>
> 基遍人就打发人往吉甲的营中去见约书亚，说：“你不要袖手不顾你的仆人，求你速速上来拯救我们，帮助我们，因为住山地亚摩利人的诸王都聚集攻击我们。”


书10:7
> So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with his entire army, including all the best fighting men.
>
> 于是，约书亚和他一切兵丁，并大能的勇士，都从吉甲上去。


书10:8
> The LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them; I have given them into your hand. Not one of them will be able to withstand you."
>
> 耶和华对约书亚说：“不要怕他们，因为我已将他们交在你手里，他们无一人能在你面前站立得住。”


书10:9
> After an all-night march from Gilgal, Joshua took them by surprise.
>
> 约书亚就终夜从吉甲上去，猛然临到他们那里。

>
> 耶和华使他们在以色列人面前溃乱。约书亚在基遍大大地杀败他们，追赶他们在伯和仑的上坡路，击杀他们直到亚西加和玛基大。


书10:11
> As they fled before Israel on the road down from Beth Horon to Azekah, the LORD hurled large hailstones down on them from the sky, and more of them died from the hailstones than were killed by the swords of the Israelites.
>
> 他们在以色列人面前逃跑，正在伯和仑下坡的时候，耶和华从天上降大冰雹（原文作“石头”）在他们身上，直降到亚西加，打死他们。被冰雹打死的，比以色列人用刀杀死的还多。


书10:12
> On the day the LORD gave the Amorites over to Israel, Joshua said to the LORD in the presence of Israel: "O sun, stand still over Gibeon, O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon."
>
> 当耶和华将亚摩利人交付以色列人的日子，约书亚就祷告耶和华，在以色列人眼前说：“日头啊，你要停在基遍；月亮啊，你要止在亚雅仑谷。”


书10:13
> So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the nation avenged itself on its enemies, as it is written in the Book of Jashar. The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day.
>
> 于是日头停留，月亮止住，直等国民向敌人报仇。这事岂不是写在雅煞珥书上吗？日头在天当中停住，不急速下落，约有一日之久。


书10:14
> There has never been a day like it before or since, a day when the LORD listened to a man. Surely the LORD was fighting for Israel!
>

书10:19
> But don't stop! Pursue your enemies, attack them from the rear and don't let them reach their cities, for the LORD your God has given them into your hand."
>
> 你们却不可耽延，要追赶你们的仇敌，击杀他们尽后边的人，不容他们进自己的城邑，因为耶和华你们的　神已经把他们交在你们手里。”


书10:20
> So Joshua and the Israelites destroyed them completely--almost to a man--but the few who were left reached their fortified cities.
>
> 约书亚和以色列人大大杀败他们，直到将他们灭尽，其中剩下的人都进了坚固的城。

>
> 众人就这样行，将那五王，就是耶路撒冷王、希伯仑王、耶末王、拉吉王、伊矶伦王，从洞里带出来，领到约书亚面前。


书10:24

>
> 带出那五王到约书亚面前的时候，约书亚就召了以色列众人来，对那些和他同去的军长说：“你们近前来，把脚踏在这些王的颈项上。”他们就近前来，把脚踏在这些王的颈项上。


书10:25
> Joshua said to them, "Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Be strong and courageous. This is what the LORD will do to all the enemies you are going to fight."
>
> 约书亚对他们说：“你们不要惧怕，也不要惊惶，应当刚强壮胆。因为耶和华必这样待你们所要攻打的一切仇敌。”


书10:26
> Then Joshua struck and killed the kings and hung them on five trees, and they were left hanging on the trees until evening.
