The LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you!

They will oppress the land, and I will not rescue them from their hands.”<p>耶和华说：“我不再怜恤这地的居民，必将这民交给各人的邻舍和他们王的手中。他们必毁灭这地，我也不救这民脱离他们的手。”</blockquote><p>亚11:7<blockquote><p>So I pastured the flock marked for slaughter, particularly the oppressed of the flock. Then I took two staffs and called one Favor and the other Union, and I pastured the flock.<p>于是，我牧养这将宰的群羊，就是羊群中最困苦的羊。我拿着两根杖，一根我称为“荣美”，一根我称为“联索”。这样，我牧养了群羊。</blockquote><p>亚11:8<blockquote><p>In one month I got rid of the three shepherds. The flock detested me, and I grew weary of them<p>一月之内，我除灭三个牧人，因为我的心厌烦他们；他们的心也憎嫌我。</blockquote><p>亚11:9<blockquote><p>and said, “I will not be your shepherd. Let the dying die, and the perishing perish.

So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the LORD to the potter.<p>耶和华吩咐我说：“要把众人所估定美好的价值丢给窑户。”我便将这三十块钱，在耶和华的殿中丢给窑户了。</blockquote><p>亚11:14<blockquote><p>Then I broke my second staff called Union, breaking the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.<p>我又折断称为“联索”的那根杖，表明我废弃犹大与以色列弟兄的情谊。</blockquote><p>亚11:15<blockquote><p>Then the LORD said to me, “Take again the equipment of a foolish shepherd.<p>耶和华又吩咐我说：“你再取愚昧牧人所用的器具。</blockquote><p>亚11:16<blockquote><p>For I am going to raise up a shepherd over the land who will not care for the lost, or seek the young, or heal the injured, or feed the healthy, but will eat the meat of the choice sheep, tearing off their hoofs.<p>因我要在这地兴起一个牧人，他不看顾丧亡的，不寻找分散的，不医治受伤的，也不牧养强壮的；却要吃肥羊的肉，撕裂它的蹄子。</blockquote><p>亚11:17<blockquote><p>“Woe to the worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock! May the sword strike his arm and his right eye! May his arm be completely withered, his right eye totally blinded!” An Oracle<p>“无用的牧人丢弃羊群有祸了！刀必临到他的膀臂和右眼上。他的膀臂必全然枯干，他的右眼也必昏暗失明。”</blockquote><h2 id="撒迦利亚书第12章">撒迦利亚书第12章</h2><p>亚12:1<blockquote><p>This is the word of the LORD concerning Israel.
