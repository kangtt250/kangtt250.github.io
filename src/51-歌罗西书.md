>
> 这福音传到你们那里，也传到普天之下，并且结果、增长，如同在你们中间，自从你们听见福音，真知道　神恩惠的日子一样。


西1:7
> You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,
>
> 正如你们从我们所亲爱、一同作仆人的以巴弗所学的。他为我们（有古卷作“你们”）作了基督忠心的执事，

>
> 既然藉着他在十字架上所流的血成就了和平，便藉着他叫万有，无论是地上的、天上的，都与自己和好了。


西1:21
> Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior.
>
> 你们从前与　神隔绝，因着恶行，心里与他为敌；


西1:22
> But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation--

> 但如今他藉着基督的肉身受死，叫你们与自己和好，都成了圣洁，没有瑕疵，无可责备，把你们引到自己面前。


西1:23
> if you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.
>
> 只要你们在所信的道上恒心，根基稳固，坚定不移，不至被引动失去（原文作“离开”）福音的盼望，这福音就是你们所听过的，也是传与普天下万人听的（“万人”原文作“凡受造的”）。我保罗也作了这福音的执事。

>
> 我们传扬他，是用诸般的智慧劝戒各人、教导各人，要把各人在基督里完完全全地引到　神面前。


西1:29

西2:4
> I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine-sounding arguments.
>
> 我说这话，免得有人用花言巧语迷惑你们。


西2:5
> For though I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit and delight to see how orderly you are and how firm your faith in Christ is.
>
> 我身子虽与你们相离，心却与你们同在，见你们循规蹈矩，信基督的心也坚固，我就欢喜了。


西2:6
> So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in him,
>
> 你们既然接受了主基督耶稣，就当遵他而行；


西2:7
> rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.
>
> 在他里面生根建造，信心坚固，正如你们所领的教训，感谢的心也更增长了。


西2:8
> See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ.
>
> 你们要谨慎，恐怕有人用他的理学和虚空的妄言，不照着基督，乃照人间的遗传和世上的小学，就把你们掳去。


西2:9
> For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form,
>
> 因为　神本性一切的丰盛，都有形有体地居住在基督里面，


西2:10
> and you have been given fullness in Christ, who is the head over every power and authority.
>
> 你们在他里面也得了丰盛。他是各样执政掌权者的元首。


西2:11
> In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of the sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by the hands of men but with the circumcision done by Christ,
>
> 你们在他里面，也受了不是人手所行的割礼，乃是基督使你们脱去肉体情欲的割礼。


西2:12
> having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.
>
> 你们既受洗与他一同埋葬，也就在此与他一同复活，都因信那叫他从死里复活　神的功用。


西2:13
> When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins,
>
> 你们从前在过犯和未受割礼的肉体中死了，　神赦免了你们（或作“我们”）一切过犯，便叫你们与基督一同活过来；


西2:14
> having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross.
>
> 又涂抹了在律例上所写攻击我们、有碍于我们的字据，把它撤去，钉在十字架上。


西2:15
> And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.
>
> 既将一切执政的、掌权的掳来，明显给众人看，就仗着十字架夸胜。


西2:16
> Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day.
>
> 所以不拘在饮食上，或节期、月朔、安息日，都不可让人论断你们。


西2:17
> These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ.
>
> 这些原是后事的影儿，那形体却是基督。


西2:18
> Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you for the prize. Such a person goes into great detail about what he has seen, and his unspiritual mind puffs him up with idle notions.
>
> 不可让人因着故意谦虚和敬拜天使，就夺去你们的奖赏。这等人拘泥在所见过的（有古卷作“这等人窥察所没有见过的”），随着自己的欲心，无故地自高自大，


西2:19
> He has lost connection with the Head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow.
>
> 不持定元首，全身既然靠着他，筋节得以相助联络，就因　神大得长进。


西2:20
> Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world, why, as though you still belonged to it, do you submit to its rules:
>
> 你们若是与基督同死，脱离了世上的小学，为什么仍像在世俗中活着，


西2:21
> "Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!"?
>
> 服从那“不可拿、不可尝、不可摸”等类的规条呢？


西2:22
> These are all destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings.
>
> 这都是照人所吩咐、所教导的。说到这一切，正用的时候就都败坏了。


西2:23
> Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.
>
> 这些规条使人徒有智慧之名，用私意崇拜，自表谦卑，苦待己身，其实在克制肉体的情欲上，是毫无功效。


## 歌罗西书第3章
西3:1
> Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
>
> 所以你们若真与基督一同复活，就当求在上面的事；那里有基督坐在　神的右边。


西3:2
> Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.
>
> 你们要思念上面的事，不要思念地上的事。


西3:3
> For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.
>
> 因为你们已经死了，你们的生命与基督一同藏在　神里面。


西3:4
> When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.
>
> 基督是我们的生命，他显现的时候，你们也要与他一同显现在荣耀里。


西3:5
> Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry.
>
> 所以要治死你们在地上的肢体，就如淫乱、污秽、邪情、恶欲和贪婪，贪婪就与拜偶像一样。


西3:6
> Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.
>
> 因这些事，　神的忿怒必临到那悖逆之子。

>
> 在此并不分希利尼人、犹太人、受割礼的、未受割礼的、化外人、西古提人、为奴的、自主的，惟有基督是包括一切，又住在各人之内。


西3:12
> Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.
>
