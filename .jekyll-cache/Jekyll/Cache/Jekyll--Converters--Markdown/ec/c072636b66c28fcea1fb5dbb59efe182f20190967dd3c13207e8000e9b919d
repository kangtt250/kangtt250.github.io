I"»<p>This week I came down with a cold so I didnâ€™t get as much done as I would have liked.
My tasks for this week were to continue working on the character design and to implement simple player movement for testing purposes.</p>

<h2 id="player-movement">Player Movement</h2>
<p>This week I mainly focused on Player Movement. 
We wanted the player to have two move speeds, a slow buildup walk speed, and an explosively quick sprint speed.
We also wanted to make use of Unityâ€™s built in physics component for 2D.
While testing we ran into a few errors with how the player interacted with the tileset at high speeds, so we need to continue tweaking the characterâ€™s maximum speeds for a while.</p>
