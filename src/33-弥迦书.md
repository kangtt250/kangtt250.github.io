# 弥迦书
## 弥迦书第1章
弥1:1
> The word of the LORD that came to Micah of Moresheth during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah--the vision he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
>
> 当犹大王约坦、亚哈斯、希西家在位的时候，摩利沙人弥迦得耶和华的默示，论撒马利亚和耶路撒冷。


弥1:2
> Hear, O peoples, all of you, listen, O earth and all who are in it, that the Sovereign LORD may witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.
>
> 万民哪，你们都要听！地和其上所有的，也都要侧耳而听！主耶和华从他的圣殿要见证你们的不是。


弥1:3
> Look! The LORD is coming from his dwelling place; he comes down and treads the high places of the earth.
>
> 看哪！耶和华出了他的居所，降临步行地的高处。


弥1:4
> The mountains melt beneath him and the valleys split apart, like wax before the fire, like water rushing down a slope.
>
> 众山在他以下必消化，诸谷必崩裂，如蜡化在火中，如水冲下山坡。


弥1:5
> All this is because of Jacob's transgression, because of the sins of the house of Israel. What is Jacob's transgression? Is it not Samaria? What is Judah's high place? Is it not Jerusalem?
>
> 这都因雅各的罪过，以色列家的罪恶。雅各的罪过在哪里呢？岂不是在撒马利亚吗？犹大的邱坛在哪里呢？岂不是在耶路撒冷吗？


弥1:6
> "Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of rubble, a place for planting vineyards. I will pour her stones into the valley and lay bare her foundations.
>
> “所以我必使撒马利亚变为田野的乱堆，又作为种葡萄之处；也必将他的石头倒在谷中，露出根基来。


弥1:7
> All her idols will be broken to pieces; all her temple gifts will be burned with fire; I will destroy all her images. Since she gathered her gifts from the wages of prostitutes, as the wages of prostitutes they will again be used."
>
> 她一切雕刻的偶像必被打碎，她所得的财物必被火烧，所有的偶像我必毁灭。因为是从妓女雇价所聚来的，后必归为妓女的雇价。


弥1:8
> Because of this I will weep and wail; I will go about barefoot and naked. I will howl like a jackal and moan like an owl.
>
> 先知说：因此我必大声哀号，赤脚露体而行；又要呼号如野狗，哀鸣如鸵鸟。


弥1:9
> For her wound is incurable; it has come to Judah. It has reached the very gate of my people, even to Jerusalem itself.
>
> 因为撒马利亚的伤痕无法医治，延及犹大和耶路撒冷我民的城门。


弥1:10
> Tell it not in Gath; weep not at all. In Beth Ophrah roll in the dust.
>
> 不要在迦特报告这事，总不要哭泣。我在伯亚弗拉滚于灰尘之中。


弥1:11
> Pass on in nakedness and shame, you who live in Shaphir. Those who live in Zaanan will not come out. Beth Ezel is in mourning; its protection is taken from you.
>
> 沙斐的居民哪，你们要赤身蒙羞过去。撒南的居民不敢出来。伯以薛人的哀哭使你们无处可站。


弥1:12
> Those who live in Maroth writhe in pain, waiting for relief, because disaster has come from the LORD, even to the gate of Jerusalem.
>
> 玛律的居民心甚忧急，切望得好处，因为灾祸从耶和华那里临到耶路撒冷的城门。


弥1:13
> You who live in Lachish, harness the team to the chariot. You were the beginning of sin to the Daughter of Zion, for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.
>
> 拉吉的居民哪，要用快马套车；锡安民（“民”原文作“女子”）的罪由你而起；以色列人的罪过在你那里显出。


弥1:14
> Therefore you will give parting gifts to Moresheth Gath. The town of Aczib will prove deceptive to the kings of Israel.
>
> 犹大啊，你要将礼物送给摩利设迦特。亚革悉的众族必用诡诈待以色列诸王。


弥1:15
> I will bring a conqueror against you who live in Mareshah. He who is the glory of Israel will come to Adullam.
>
> 玛利沙的居民哪，我必使那夺取你的来到你这里；以色列的尊贵人（原文作“荣耀”）必到亚杜兰。


弥1:16
> Shave your heads in mourning for the children in whom you delight; make yourselves as bald as the vulture, for they will go from you into exile.
>
> 犹大啊，要为你所喜爱的儿女剪除你的头发，使头光秃，要大大地光秃，如同秃鹰，因为他们都被掳去离开你。


## 弥迦书第2章
弥2:1
> Woe to those who plan iniquity, to those who plot evil on their beds! At morning's light they carry it out because it is in their power to do it.
>
> 祸哉！那些在床上图谋罪孽造作奸恶的，天一发亮，因手有能力，就行出来了。


弥2:2
> They covet fields and seize them, and houses, and take them. They defraud a man of his home, a fellowman of his inheritance.
>
> 他们贪图田地就占据，贪图房屋便夺取；他们欺压人，霸占房屋和产业。


弥2:3
> Therefore, the LORD says: "I am planning disaster against this people, from which you cannot save yourselves. You will no longer walk proudly, for it will be a time of calamity.
>
> 所以耶和华如此说：“我筹划灾祸降与这族，这祸在你们的颈项上不能解脱；你们也不能昂首而行，因为这时势是恶的。


弥2:4
> In that day men will ridicule you; they will taunt you with this mournful song: 'We are utterly ruined; my people's possession is divided up. He takes it from me! He assigns our fields to traitors.'"
>
> 到那日，必有人向你们提起悲惨的哀歌，讥刺说：‘我们全然败落了！耶和华将我们的分转归别人，何竟使这分离开我们？他将我们的田地分给悖逆的人。’”


弥2:5
> Therefore you will have no one in the assembly of the LORD to divide the land by lot.
>
> 所以在耶和华的会中，你必没有人拈阄、拉准绳。


弥2:6
> "Do not prophesy," their prophets say. "Do not prophesy about these things; disgrace will not overtake us."
>
> 他们（或作“假先知”）说：“你们不可说预言，不可向这些人说预言，不住地羞辱我们。”


弥2:7
> Should it be said, O house of Jacob: "Is the Spirit of the LORD angry? Does he do such things?" "Do not my words do good to him whose ways are upright?
>
> 雅各家啊，岂可说：“耶和华的心不忍耐吗（或作“心肠狭窄吗”）？这些事是他所行的吗？”“我耶和华的言语岂不是与行动正直的人有益吗？”


弥2:8
> Lately my people have risen up like an enemy. You strip off the rich robe from those who pass by without a care, like men returning from battle.
>
> 然而近来我的民兴起如仇敌，从那些安然经过不愿打仗之人身上剥去外衣。


弥2:9
> You drive the women of my people from their pleasant homes. You take away my blessing from their children forever.
>
> 你们将我民中的妇人从安乐家中赶出，又将我的荣耀从她们的小孩子尽行夺去。


弥2:10
> Get up, go away! For this is not your resting place, because it is defiled, it is ruined, beyond all remedy.
>
> 你们起来去吧！这不是你们安息之所，因为污秽使人（或作“地”）毁灭，而且大大毁灭。


弥2:11
> If a liar and deceiver comes and says, 'I will prophesy for you plenty of wine and beer,' he would be just the prophet for this people!
>
> 若有人心存虚假，用谎言说：‘我要向你们预言得清酒和浓酒’，那人就必作这民的先知！


弥2:12
> "I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob; I will surely bring together the remnant of Israel. I will bring them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock in its pasture; the place will throng with people.
>
> “雅各家啊，我必要聚集你们，必要招聚以色列剩下的人，安置在一处，如波斯拉的羊，又如草场上的羊群；因为人数众多，就必大大喧哗。


弥2:13
> One who breaks open the way will go up before them; they will break through the gate and go out. Their king will pass through before them, the LORD at their head."
>
> 开路的（或作“破城的”）在他们前面上去，他们直闯过城门，从城门出去。他们的王在前面行，耶和华引导他们。”


## 弥迦书第3章
弥3:1
> Then I said, "Listen, you leaders of Jacob, you rulers of the house of Israel. Should you not know justice,
>
> 我说：“雅各的首领、以色列家的官长啊，你们要听！你们不当知道公平吗？


弥3:2
> you who hate good and love evil; who tear the skin from my people and the flesh from their bones;
>
> 你们恶善好恶，从人身上剥皮，从人骨头上剔肉。


弥3:3
> who eat my people's flesh, strip off their skin and break their bones in pieces; who chop them up like meat for the pan, like flesh for the pot?"
>
> 吃我民的肉，剥他们的皮，打折他们的骨头，分成块子像要下锅，又像釜中的肉。”


弥3:4
> Then they will cry out to the LORD, but he will not answer them. At that time he will hide his face from them because of the evil they have done.
>
> 到了遭灾的时候，这些人必哀求耶和华，他却不应允他们；那时他必照他们所行的恶事，向他们掩面。


弥3:5
> This is what the LORD says: "As for the prophets who lead my people astray, if one feeds them, they proclaim 'peace'; if he does not, they prepare to wage war against him.
>
> “论到使我民走差路的先知，他们牙齿有所嚼的，他们就呼喊说：‘平安了！’凡不供给他们吃的，他们就预备攻击他（“预备攻击他”或作“说必遭遇刀兵”）。”耶和华如此说：


弥3:6
> Therefore night will come over you, without visions, and darkness, without divination. The sun will set for the prophets, and the day will go dark for them.
>
> “你们必遭遇黑夜，以致不见异象；又必遭遇幽暗，以致不能占卜。日头必向你们沉落，白昼变为黑暗；


弥3:7
> The seers will be ashamed and the diviners disgraced. They will all cover their faces because there is no answer from God."
>
> 先见必抱愧，占卜的必蒙羞，都必捂着嘴唇，因为　神不应允他们。”


弥3:8
> But as for me, I am filled with power, with the Spirit of the LORD, and with justice and might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, to Israel his sin.
>
> 至于我，我借耶和华的灵，满有力量、公平、才能，可以向雅各说明他的过犯，向以色列指出他的罪恶。


弥3:9
> Hear this, you leaders of the house of Jacob, you rulers of the house of Israel, who despise justice and distort all that is right;
>
> 雅各家的首领、以色列家的官长啊，当听我的话！你们厌恶公平，在一切事上屈枉正直；


弥3:10
> who build Zion with bloodshed, and Jerusalem with wickedness.
>
> 以人血建立锡安，以罪孽建造耶路撒冷。


弥3:11
> Her leaders judge for a bribe, her priests teach for a price, and her prophets tell fortunes for money. Yet they lean upon the LORD and say, "Is not the LORD among us? No disaster will come upon us."
>
> 首领为贿赂行审判，祭司为雇价施训诲，先知为银钱行占卜。他们却倚赖耶和华说：“耶和华不是在我们中间吗？灾祸必不临到我们！”


弥3:12
> Therefore because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.
>
> 所以因你们的缘故，锡安必被耕种像一块田，耶路撒冷必变为乱堆，这殿的山必像丛林的高处。


## 弥迦书第4章
弥4:1
> In the last days the mountain of the LORD'S temple will be established as chief among the mountains; it will be raised above the hills, and peoples will stream to it.
>
> 末后的日子，耶和华殿的山必坚立，超乎诸山，高举过于万岭；万民都要流归这山。


弥4:2
> Many nations will come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths." The law will go out from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
>
> 必有许多国的民前往说：“来吧！我们登耶和华的山，奔雅各　神的殿。主必将他的道教训我们，我们也要行他的路。”因为训诲必出于锡安，耶和华的言语必出于耶路撒冷。


弥4:3
> He will judge between many peoples and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.
>
> 他必在多国的民中施行审判，为远方强盛的国断定是非。他们要将刀打成犁头，把枪打成镰刀。这国不举刀攻击那国，他们也不再学习战事。


弥4:4
> Every man will sit under his own vine and under his own fig tree, and no one will make them afraid, for the LORD Almighty has spoken.
>
> 人人都要坐在自己葡萄树下和无花果树下，无人惊吓。这是万军之耶和华亲口说的。


弥4:5
> All the nations may walk in the name of their gods; we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.
>
> 万民各奉己　神的名而行，我们却永永远远奉耶和华我们　神的名而行。


弥4:6
> "In that day," declares the LORD, "I will gather the lame; I will assemble the exiles and those I have brought to grief.
>
> 耶和华说：“到那日，我必聚集瘸腿的，招聚被赶出的和我所惩治的。


弥4:7
> I will make the lame a remnant, those driven away a strong nation. The LORD will rule over them in Mount Zion from that day and forever.
>
> 我必使瘸腿的为余剩之民，使赶到远方的为强盛之民。耶和华要在锡安山作王治理他们，从今直到永远。


弥4:8
> As for you, O watchtower of the flock, O stronghold of the Daughter of Zion, the former dominion will be restored to you; kingship will come to the Daughter of Jerusalem."
>
> 你这羊群的高台、锡安城的山哪（“城”原文作“女子”），从前的权柄，就是耶路撒冷民（原文作“女子”）的国权，必归与你。”


弥4:9
> Why do you now cry aloud--have you no king? Has your counselor perished, that pain seizes you like that of a woman in labor?
>
> 现在你为何大声哭号呢？疼痛抓住你仿佛产难的妇人，是因你中间没有君王吗？你的谋士灭亡了吗？


弥4:10
> Writhe in agony, O Daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you must leave the city to camp in the open field. You will go to Babylon; there you will be rescued. There the LORD will redeem you out of the hand of your enemies.
>
> 锡安的民哪（“民”原文作“女子”），你要疼痛劬劳，仿佛产难的妇人；因为你必从城里出来，住在田野，到巴比伦去。在那里要蒙解救，在那里耶和华必救赎你脱离仇敌的手。


弥4:11
> But now many nations are gathered against you. They say, "Let her be defiled, let our eyes gloat over Zion!"
>
> 现在有许多国的民聚集攻击你说：“愿锡安被玷污，愿我们亲眼见她遭报。”


弥4:12
> But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD; they do not understand his plan, he who gathers them like sheaves to the threshing floor.
>
> 他们却不知道耶和华的意念，也不明白他的筹划。他聚集他们，好像把禾捆聚到禾场一样。


弥4:13
> "Rise and thresh, O Daughter of Zion, for I will give you horns of iron; I will give you hoofs of bronze and you will break to pieces many nations." You will devote their ill-gotten gains to the LORD, their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.
>
> “锡安的民哪（“民”原文作“女子”），起来踹谷吧！我必使你的角成为铁，使你的蹄成为铜。你必打碎多国的民。”将他们的财献与耶和华，将他们的货献与普天下的主。


## 弥迦书第5章
弥5:1
> Marshal your troops, O city of troops, for a siege is laid against us. They will strike Israel's ruler on the cheek with a rod.
>
> 成群的民哪（“民”原文作“女子”），现在你要聚集成队；因为仇敌围攻我们，要用杖击打以色列审判者的脸。


弥5:2
> "But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times."
>
> “伯利恒、以法他啊，你在犹大诸城中为小，将来必有一位从你那里出来，在以色列中为我作掌权的；他的根源从亘古、从太初就有。”


弥5:3
> Therefore Israel will be abandoned until the time when she who is in labor gives birth and the rest of his brothers return to join the Israelites.
>
> 耶和华必将以色列人交付敌人，直等那生产的妇人生下子来。那时，掌权者（原文作“他”）其余的弟兄必归到以色列人那里。


弥5:4
> He will stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God. And they will live securely, for then his greatness will reach to the ends of the earth.
>
> 他必起来，倚靠耶和华的大能，并耶和华他　神之名的威严，牧养他的羊群。他们要安然居住；因为他必日见尊大，直到地极。


弥5:5
> And he will be their peace. When the Assyrian invades our land and marches through our fortresses, we will raise against him seven shepherds, even eight leaders of men.
>
> 这位必作我们的平安。当亚述人进入我们的地境，践踏宫殿的时候，我们就立起七个牧者、八个首领攻击他。


弥5:6
> They will rule the land of Assyria with the sword, the land of Nimrod with drawn sword. He will deliver us from the Assyrian when he invades our land and marches into our borders.
>
> 他们必用刀剑毁坏亚述地和宁录地的关口。亚述人进入我们的地境践踏的时候，他必拯救我们。


弥5:7
> The remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples like dew from the LORD, like showers on the grass, which do not wait for man or linger for mankind.
>
> 雅各余剩的人必在多国的民中，如从耶和华那里降下的露水，又如甘霖降在草上；不仗赖人力，也不等候世人之功。


弥5:8
> The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among flocks of sheep, which mauls and mangles as it goes, and no one can rescue.
>
> 雅各余剩的人必在多国多民中，如林间百兽中的狮子，又如少壮狮子在羊群中。他若经过，就必践踏撕裂，无人搭救。


弥5:9
> Your hand will be lifted up in triumph over your enemies, and all your foes will be destroyed.
>
> 愿你的手举起，高过敌人！愿你的仇敌都被剪除！


弥5:10
> "In that day," declares the LORD, "I will destroy your horses from among you and demolish your chariots.
>
> 耶和华说：“到那日，我必从你中间剪除马匹，毁坏车辆，


弥5:11

弥6:1
> Listen to what the LORD says: "Stand up, plead your case before the mountains; let the hills hear what you have to say.
>
> 以色列人哪，当听耶和华的话！“要起来向山岭争辩，使冈陵听你的话。


弥6:2

>
> 山岭和地永久的根基啊，要听耶和华争辩的话！因为耶和华要与他的百姓争辩，与以色列争论。


弥6:3

>

弥6:6
> With what shall I come before the LORD and bow down before the exalted God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old?
>
> 我朝见耶和华，在至高　神面前跪拜，当献上什么呢？岂可献一岁的牛犊为燔祭吗？

弥6:14
> You will eat but not be satisfied; your stomach will still be empty. You will store up but save nothing, because what you save I will give to the sword.
>
> 你要吃，却吃不饱；你的虚弱必显在你中间。你必挪去，却不得救护；所救护的，我必交给刀剑。

>
> 因为你守暗利的恶规，行亚哈家一切所行的，顺从他们的计谋；因此，我必使你荒凉，使你的居民令人嗤笑，你们也必担当我民的羞辱。”


## 弥迦书第7章
弥7:1
> What misery is mine! I am like one who gathers summer fruit at the gleaning of the vineyard; there is no cluster of grapes to eat, none of the early figs that I crave.
>
> 哀哉！我（或指“以色列”）好像夏天的果子已被收尽，又像摘了葡萄所剩下的，没有一挂可吃的。我心羡慕初熟的无花果。


弥7:2
> The godly have been swept from the land; not one upright man remains. All men lie in wait to shed blood; each hunts his brother with a net.
>
> 地上虔诚人灭尽，世间没有正直人；各人埋伏要杀人流血，都用网罗猎取弟兄。


弥7:3
> Both hands are skilled in doing evil; the ruler demands gifts, the judge accepts bribes, the powerful dictate what they desire--they all conspire together.
>
> 他们双手作恶；君王徇情面，审判官要贿赂，位分大的吐出恶意，都彼此结联行恶。


弥7:4
> The best of them is like a brier, the most upright worse than a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen has come, the day God visits you. Now is the time of their confusion.
>
> 他们最好的，不过是蒺藜；最正直的，不过是荆棘篱笆。你守望者说，降罚的日子已经来到，他们必扰乱不安。


弥7:5
> Do not trust a neighbor; put no confidence in a friend. Even with her who lies in your embrace be careful of your words.
>
> 不要倚赖邻舍，不要信靠密友；要守住你的口，不要向你怀中的妻提说。


弥7:6
> For a son dishonors his father, a daughter rises up against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law--a man's enemies are the members of his own household.
>
> 因为儿子藐视父亲，女儿抗拒母亲，媳妇抗拒婆婆；人的仇敌就是自己家里的人。


弥7:7
> But as for me, I watch in hope for the LORD, I wait for God my Savior; my God will hear me.
>
> 至于我，我要仰望耶和华，要等候那救我的　神，我的　神必应允我。


弥7:8
> Do not gloat over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will rise. Though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light.
>
> 我的仇敌啊，不要向我夸耀。我虽跌倒，却要起来；我虽坐在黑暗里，耶和华却作我的光。


弥7:9
> Because I have sinned against him, I will bear the LORD'S wrath, until he pleads my case and establishes my right. He will bring me out into the light; I will see his righteousness.
>
> 我要忍受耶和华的恼怒，因我得罪了他，直等他为我辨屈，为我伸冤。他必领我到光明中，我必得见他的公义。


弥7:10
> Then my enemy will see it and will be covered with shame, she who said to me, "Where is the LORD your God?" My eyes will see her downfall; even now she will be trampled underfoot like mire in the streets.
>
> 那时我的仇敌，就是曾对我说“耶和华你　神在哪里”的，他一看见这事，就被羞愧遮盖。我必亲眼见他遭报，他必被践踏，如同街上的泥土。


弥7:11
> The day for building your walls will come, the day for extending your boundaries.
>
> 以色列啊，日子必到，你的墙垣必重修；到那日，你的境界必开展（或作“命令必传到远方”）。


弥7:12
