    <p>Curiosity has its own reason for existence.</p>

<p>If you want to be rewarded, you have to be irreplaceable.</p>

<p>If you want to be irreplaceable, you have to be unique.</p>

<p>If you want to be unique, you have to be authentic.</p>

<p>If you want to be authentic, stop listening to everyone and everything else.</p>

<p>It’s drowning “you” out.</p>
