There the hand of the LORD was upon him.<p>在迦勒底人之地、迦巴鲁河边，耶和华的话特特临到布西的儿子祭司以西结，耶和华的灵（原文作“手”）降在他身上。</blockquote><p>结1:4<blockquote><p>I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north–an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal,<p>我观看，见狂风从北方刮来，随着有一朵包括闪烁火的大云，周围有光辉，从其中的火内发出好像光耀的精金；</blockquote><p>结1:5<blockquote><p>and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was that of a man,<p>又从其中显出四个活物的形像来。他们的形状是这样：有人的形像，</blockquote><p>结1:6<blockquote><p>but each of them had four faces and four wings.<p>各有四个脸面，四个翅膀；</blockquote><p>结1:7<blockquote><p>Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze.<p>他们的腿是直的，脚掌好像牛犊之蹄，都灿烂如光明的铜；</blockquote><p>结1:8<blockquote><p>Under their wings on their four sides they had the hands of a man. All four of them had faces and wings,<p>在四面的翅膀以下有人的手。这四个活物的脸和翅膀乃是这样：</blockquote><p>结1:9<blockquote><p>and their wings touched one another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.<p>翅膀彼此相接，行走并不转身，俱各直往前行；</blockquote><p>结1:10<blockquote><p>Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a man, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle.<p>至于脸的形像：前面各有人的脸，右面各有狮子的脸，左面各有牛的脸，后面各有鹰的脸。</blockquote><p>结1:11<blockquote><p>Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out upward; each had two wings, one touching the wing of another creature on either side, and two wings covering its body.<p>各展开上边的两个翅膀相接，各以下边的两个翅膀遮体。</blockquote><p>结1:12<blockquote><p>Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went.<p>他们俱各直往前行，灵往哪里去，他们就往那里去，行走并不转身。</blockquote><p>结1:13<blockquote><p>The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it.<p>至于四活物的形像，就如烧着火炭的形状，又如火把的形状。火在四活物中间上去下来，这火有光辉，从火中发出闪电。</blockquote><p>结1:14<blockquote><p>The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.<p>这活物往来奔走，好像电光一闪。</blockquote><p>结1:15<blockquote><p>As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.<p>我正观看活物的时候，见活物的脸旁，各有一轮在地上。</blockquote><p>结1:16<blockquote><p>This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like chrysolite, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel.<p>轮的形状和颜色（原文作“做法”）好像水苍玉。四轮都是一个样式，形状和作法好像轮中套轮。</blockquote><p>结1:17<blockquote><p>As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not turn about as the creatures went.<p>轮行走的时候，向四方都能直行，并不掉转。</blockquote><p>结1:18<blockquote><p>Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.<p>至于轮辋，高而可畏；四个轮辋周围满有眼睛。</blockquote><p>结1:19<blockquote><p>When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose.<p>活物行走，轮也在旁边行走；活物从地上升，轮也都上升；</blockquote><p>结1:20<blockquote><p>Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.<p>灵往哪里去，活物就往那里去；活物上升，轮也在活物旁边上升，因为活物的灵在轮中。</blockquote><p>结1:21<blockquote><p>When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.<p>那些行走，这些也行走；那些站住，这些也站住。那些从地上升，轮也在旁边上升，因为活物的灵在轮中。</blockquote><p>结1:22<blockquote><p>Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked like an expanse, sparkling like ice, and awesome.<p>活物的头以上有穹苍的形像，看着像可畏的水晶，铺张在活物的头以上。</blockquote><p>结1:23<blockquote><p>Under the expanse their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body.<p>穹苍以下，活物的翅膀直张，彼此相对，每活物有两个翅膀遮体。</blockquote><p>结1:24<blockquote><p>When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty, like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.<p>活物行走的时候，我听见翅膀的响声，像大水的声音，像全能者的声音，也像军队哄嚷的声音。活物站住的时候，便将翅膀垂下。</blockquote><p>结1:25<blockquote><p>Then there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood with lowered wings.<p>在他们头以上的穹苍之上有声音。他们站住的时候，便将翅膀垂下。</blockquote><p>结1:26<blockquote><p>Above the expanse over their heads was what looked like a throne of sapphire, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man.<p>在他们头以上的穹苍之上有宝座的形像，仿佛蓝宝石；在宝座形像以上有仿佛人的形状。</blockquote><p>结1:27<blockquote><p>I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him.<p>我见从他腰以上有仿佛光耀的精金，周围都有火的形状；又见从他腰以下有仿佛火的形状，周围也有光辉。</blockquote><p>结1:28<blockquote><p>Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.<p>下雨的日子，云中虹的形状怎样，周围光辉的形状也是怎样。这就是耶和华荣耀的形像。我一看见就俯伏在地，又听见一位说话的声音。</blockquote><h2 id="以西结书第2章">以西结书第2章</h2><p>结2:1<blockquote><p>He said to me, “Son of man, stand up on your feet and I will speak to you.”<p>他对我说：“人子啊，你站起来，我要和你说话。”</blockquote><p>结2:2<blockquote><p>As he spoke, the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet, and I heard him speaking to me.<p>他对我说话的时候，灵就进入我里面，使我站起来，我便听见那位对我说话的声音。</blockquote><p>结2:3<blockquote><p>He said: “Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me; they and their fathers have been in revolt against me to this very day.<p>他对我说：“人子啊，我差你往悖逆的国民以色列人那里去。他们是悖逆我的，他们和他们的列祖违背我，直到今日。</blockquote><p>结2:4<blockquote><p>The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and stubborn. Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says.’<p>这众子面无羞耻，心里刚硬。我差你往他们那里去，你要对他们说：‘主耶和华如此说。’</blockquote><p>结2:5<blockquote><p>And whether they listen or fail to listen–for they are a rebellious house–they will know that a prophet has been among them.<p>他们或听或不听（他们是悖逆之家），必知道在他们中间有了先知。</blockquote><p>结2:6<blockquote><p>And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns are all around you and you live among scorpions. Do not be afraid of what they say or terrified by them, though they are a rebellious house.<p>人子啊，虽有荆棘和蒺藜在你那里，你又住在蝎子中间，总不要怕他们，也不要怕他们的话；他们虽是悖逆之家，还不要怕他们的话，也不要因他们的脸色惊惶。</blockquote><p>结2:7<blockquote><p>You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or fail to listen, for they are rebellious.<p>他们或听或不听，你只管将我的话告诉他们。他们是极其悖逆的。</blockquote><p>结2:8<blockquote><p>But you, son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not rebel like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you.”<p>人子啊，要听我对你所说的话，不要悖逆像那悖逆之家，你要开口吃我所赐给你的。”</blockquote><p>结2:9<blockquote><p>Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll,<p>我观看，见有一只手向我伸出来，手中有一书卷。</blockquote><p>结2:10<blockquote><p>which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe.<p>他将书卷在我面前展开，内外都写着字，其上所写的有哀号、叹息、悲痛的话。</blockquote><h2 id="以西结书第3章">以西结书第3章</h2><p>结3:1<blockquote><p>And he said to me, “Son of man, eat what is before you, eat this scroll; then go and speak to the house of Israel.”<p>他对我说：“人子啊，要吃你所得的，要吃这书卷，好去对以色列家讲说。”</blockquote><p>结3:2<blockquote><p>So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat.<p>于是我开口，他就使我吃这书卷。</blockquote><p>结3:3<blockquote><p>Then he said to me, “Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving you and fill your stomach with it.” So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.<p>又对我说：“人子啊，要吃我所赐给你的这书卷，充满你的肚腹。”我就吃了，口中觉得其甜如蜜。</blockquote><p>结3:4<blockquote><p>He then said to me: “Son of man, go now to the house of Israel and speak my words to them.<p>他对我说：“人子啊，你往以色列家那里去，将我的话对他们讲说。</blockquote><p>结3:5<blockquote><p>You are not being sent to a people of obscure speech and difficult language, but to the house of Israel–<p>你奉差遣不是往那说话深奥、言语难懂的民那里去，乃是往以色列家去。</blockquote><p>结3:6<blockquote><p>not to many peoples of obscure speech and difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you.<p>不是往那说话深奥、言语难懂的多国去，他们的话语是你不懂得的；我若差你往他们那里去，他们必听从你。</blockquote><p>结3:7<blockquote><p>But the house of Israel is not willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to me, for the whole house of Israel is hardened and obstinate.<p>以色列家却不肯听从你，因为他们不肯听从我；原来以色列全家是额坚心硬的人。</blockquote><p>结3:8<blockquote><p>But I will make you as unyielding and hardened as they are.<p>看哪！我使你的脸硬过他们的脸，使你的额硬过他们的额。</blockquote><p>结3:9<blockquote><p>I will make your forehead like the hardest stone, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or terrified by them, though they are a rebellious house.”<p>我使你的额像金钢钻，比火石更硬。他们虽是悖逆之家，你不要怕他们，也不要因他们的脸色惊惶。”</blockquote><p>结3:10<blockquote><p>And he said to me, “Son of man, listen carefully and take to heart all the words I speak to you.<p>他又对我说：“人子啊，我对你所说的一切话，要心里领会，耳中听闻。</blockquote><p>结3:11<blockquote><p>Go now to your countrymen in exile and speak to them. Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says,’ whether they listen or fail to listen.”<p>你往你本国被掳的子民那里去，他们或听或不听，你要对他们讲说，告诉他们：‘这是主耶和华说的。’”</blockquote><p>结3:12<blockquote><p>Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a loud rumbling sound–May the glory of the LORD be praised in his dwelling place!–<p>那时，灵将我举起，我就听见在我身后有震动轰轰的声音说：“从耶和华的所在显出来的荣耀是该称颂的！”</blockquote><p>结3:13<blockquote><p>the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound.<p>我又听见那活物翅膀相碰，与活物旁边轮子旋转震动轰轰的响声。</blockquote><p>结3:14<blockquote><p>The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of the LORD upon me.<p>于是，灵将我举起带我而去。我心中甚苦，灵性忿激，并且耶和华的灵（原文作“手”）在我身上大有能力。</blockquote><p>结3:15<blockquote><p>I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Abib near the Kebar River. And there, where they were living, I sat among them for seven days–overwhelmed.<p>我就来到提勒亚毕，住在迦巴鲁河边被掳的人那里，到他们所住的地方，在他们中间忧忧闷闷地坐了七日。</blockquote><p>结3:16<blockquote><p>At the end of seven days the word of the LORD came to me:<p>过了七日，耶和华的话临到我说：</blockquote><p>结3:17<blockquote><p>“Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me.<p>“人子啊，我立你作以色列家守望的人，所以你要听我口中的话，替我警戒他们。</blockquote><p>结3:18<blockquote><p>When I say to a wicked man, ‘You will surely die,’ and you do not warn him or speak out to dissuade him from his evil ways in order to save his life, that wicked man will die for his sin, and I will hold you accountable for his blood.<p>我何时指着恶人说他必要死，你若不警戒他，也不劝戒他，使他离开恶行，拯救他的性命，这恶人必死在罪孽之中；我却要向你讨他丧命的罪（原文作“血”）。</blockquote><p>结3:19<blockquote><p>But if you do warn the wicked man and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his evil ways, he will die for his sin; but you will have saved yourself.<p>倘若你警戒恶人，他仍不转离罪恶，也不离开恶行，他必死在罪孽之中；你却救自己脱离了罪。</blockquote><p>结3:20<blockquote><p>“Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and does evil, and I put a stumbling block before him, he will die. Since you did not warn him, he will die for his sin.
