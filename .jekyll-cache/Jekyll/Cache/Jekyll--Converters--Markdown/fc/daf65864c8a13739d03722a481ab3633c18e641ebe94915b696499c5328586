<p>This week I decided to look into an alternate method of checking surface angles. I’ve had success with this new method,
as opposed to the custom tilemap method I’ve referred to earlier. I’ll elaborate further below.</p>

A myriad of issues I encountered upon opening Visual Studio this week.</p>

<p>Before I had a chance to try this new approach however, I encountered a number of issues in Visual Studio. 
I couldn’t load Project Viteză, or any project for that matter, Unity or not. I was stumped as to what to do, I 
couldn’t find much assistance online, apart from mentions of updating VS. I decided that updating VS was the best 
course of action.</p>

The Update process, thankfully it served my purposes.</p>

<p>Thankfully, an update was the fix for this issue. I would have been quite stuck if I couldn’t eliminate this issue
fast.</p>

<h1 id="raycast-normal-method">Raycast-Normal Method</h1>

<p>After some research on using raycasts to detect vector normals, I implemented a simple raycast that shoots from
Katt’s feet to the ground below her. This raycast then detects the normal of the platform she’s on and adjusts Katt’s
angle to the angle found by the detected normal. This simple method has given me much more success than the Tilemap
method, and so I removed the custom tiles and brushes from the project since they were no longer needed. A lot of 
improvements will need to be made to this raycast system, but I am confident that I can finally move forward with 
it and implement more features into the movement script. The images below will demonstrate the method.</p>

<p>That’s it for this week, a lot more tweaks will be needed to improve this functionality, but I feel this is a good 
start. The first issue I’d like to fix is to get Katt to revert her rotation upon becoming airborne again, at the moment
she remains at the angle of the previous normal she detected until she’s detected a new normal.</p>

<p>‘Til next time!</p>
