I"3<p>As I was working on the new movement script for Katt this past week, I came across an issue: I wanted Katt to 
stand at an angle appropriate to the surface sheâ€™s standing on. (For example, her sprite would be tilted 45 
degrees while standing on a 45 degree slope.) How could I get her to do this?</p>
