太15:2
> "Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don't wash their hands before they eat!"
>
> “你的门徒为什么犯古人的遗传呢？因为吃饭的时候，他们不洗手。”


太15:3
> Jesus replied, "And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?
>
> 耶稣回答说：“你们为什么因着你们的遗传，犯　神的诫命呢？


太15:4
> For God said, 'Honor your father and mother' and 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.'
>
> 神说：‘当孝敬父母’，又说：‘咒骂父母的，必治死他。’


太15:5
> But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is a gift devoted to God,'
>
> 你们倒说：‘无论何人对父母说，我所当奉给你的，已经作了供献，


太15:6
> he is not to 'honor his father' with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.
>
> 他就可以不孝敬父母。’这就是你们借着遗传，废了　神的诫命。


太15:7
> You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:
>
> 假冒为善的人哪！以赛亚指着你们说的预言是不错的。他说：


太15:8
> "'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
>
> ‘这百姓用嘴唇尊敬我，心却远离我；


太15:9
> They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.'"
>
> 他们将人的吩咐当作道理教导人，所以拜我也是枉然。’”


太15:10
> Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
>
> 耶稣就叫了众人来，对他们说：“你们要听，也要明白。


太15:11
> What goes into a man's mouth does not make him 'unclean,' but what comes out of his mouth, that is what makes him 'unclean.'"
>
> 入口的不能污秽人，出口的乃能污秽人。”


太15:12
> Then the disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
>
> 当时，门徒进前来对他说：“法利赛人听见这话不服（“不服”原文作“跌倒”），你知道吗？”


太15:13
> He replied, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots.
>
> 耶稣回答说：“凡栽种的物，若不是我天父栽种的，必要拔出来。


太15:14
> Leave them; they are blind guides. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit."

> 彼得对耶稣说：“请将这比喻讲给我们听。”


太15:16
> "Are you still so dull?" Jesus asked them.
>
> 耶稣说：“你们到如今还不明白吗？


太15:17
> "Don't you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body?
>
> 岂不知凡入口的，是运到肚子里，又落在茅厕里吗？


太15:18
> But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these make a man 'unclean.'
>
> 惟独出口的，是从心里发出来的，这才污秽人。


太15:19
> For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.
>
> 因为从心里发出来的，有恶念、凶杀、奸淫、苟合、偷盗、妄证、谤渎，


太15:20
> These are what make a man 'unclean'; but eating with unwashed hands does not make him 'unclean.'"
>
> 这都是污秽人的。至于不洗手吃饭，那却不污秽人。”

>
> 耶稣叫门徒来，说：“我怜悯这众人，因为他们同我在这里已经三天，也没有吃的了。我不愿意叫他们饿着回去，恐怕在路上困乏。”


太15:33
> His disciples answered, "Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?"
>
> 门徒说：“我们在这野地，哪里有这么多的饼叫这许多人吃饱呢？”


太15:34
> "How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked. "Seven," they replied, "and a few small fish."

> 当复活的时候，人也不娶，也不嫁，乃像天上的使者一样。


太22:31
