Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.<p>犹太全地和耶路撒冷的人都出去到约翰那里，承认他们的罪，在约旦河里受他的洗。</blockquote><p>可1:6<blockquote><p>John wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.<p>约翰穿骆驼毛的衣服，腰束皮带，吃的是蝗虫野蜜。</blockquote><p>可1:7<blockquote><p>And this was his message: “After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.<p>他传道说：“有一位在我以后来的，能力比我更大，我就是弯腰给他解鞋带也是不配的。</blockquote><p>可1:8<blockquote><p>I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”<p>我是用水给你们施洗，他却要用圣灵给你们施洗。”</blockquote><p>可1:9<blockquote><p>At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.<p>那时，耶稣从加利利的拿撒勒来，在约旦河里受了约翰的洗。</blockquote><p>可1:10<blockquote><p>As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.<p>他从水里一上来，就看见天裂开了，圣灵仿佛鸽子，降在他身上。</blockquote><p>可1:11<blockquote><p>And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.”<p>又有声音从天上来，说：“你是我的爱子，我喜悦你。”</blockquote><p>可1:12<blockquote><p>At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert,<p>圣灵就把耶稣催到旷野里去。</blockquote><p>可1:13<blockquote><p>and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.<p>他在旷野四十天，受撒但的试探，并与野兽同在一处；且有天使来伺候他。</blockquote><p>可1:14<blockquote><p>After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.<p>约翰下监以后，耶稣来到加利利，宣传　神的福音，</blockquote><p>可1:15<blockquote><p>“The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!”<p>说：“日期满了，　神的国近了！你们当悔改，信福音！”</blockquote><p>可1:16<blockquote><p>As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.<p>耶稣顺着加利利的海边走，看见西门和西门的兄弟安得烈在海里撒网，他们本是打鱼的。</blockquote><p>可1:17<blockquote><p>“Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.”<p>耶稣对他们说：“来跟从我！我要叫你们得人如得鱼一样。”</blockquote><p>可1:18<blockquote><p>At once they left their nets and followed him.<p>他们就立刻舍了网，跟从了他。</blockquote><p>可1:19<blockquote><p>When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.<p>耶稣稍往前走，又见西庇太的儿子雅各和雅各的兄弟约翰在船上补网。</blockquote><p>可1:20<blockquote><p>Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.<p>耶稣随即招呼他们，他们就把父亲西庇太和雇工人留在船上，跟从耶稣去了。</blockquote><p>可1:21<blockquote><p>They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.<p>到了迦百农，耶稣就在安息日进了会堂教训人。</blockquote><p>可1:22<blockquote><p>The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.<p>众人很希奇他的教训，因为他教训他们，正像有权柄的人，不像文士。</blockquote><p>可1:23<blockquote><p>Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out,<p>在会堂里，有一个人被污鬼附着。他喊叫说：</blockquote><p>可1:24<blockquote><p>“What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are–the Holy One of God!”<p>“拿撒勒人耶稣，我们与你有什么相干，你来灭我们吗？我知道你是谁，乃是　神的圣者！”</blockquote><p>可1:25<blockquote><p>“Be quiet!” said Jesus sternly. “Come out of him!”<p>耶稣责备他说：“不要做声，从这人身上出来吧！”</blockquote><p>可1:26<blockquote><p>The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.<p>污鬼叫那人抽了一阵风，大声喊叫，就出来了。</blockquote><p>可1:27<blockquote><p>The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, “What is this? A new teaching–and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him.”<p>众人都惊讶，以致彼此对问说：“这是什么事？是个新道理啊！他用权柄吩咐污鬼，连污鬼也听从了他。”</blockquote><p>可1:28<blockquote><p>News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.<p>耶稣的名声就传遍了加利利的四方。</blockquote><p>可1:29<blockquote><p>As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.<p>他们一出会堂，就同着雅各、约翰，进了西门和安得烈的家。</blockquote><p>可1:30<blockquote><p>Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.<p>西门的岳母正害热病躺着，就有人告诉耶稣。</blockquote><p>可1:31<blockquote><p>So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.<p>耶稣进前拉着她的手，扶她起来，热就退了，她就服事他们。</blockquote><p>可1:32<blockquote><p>That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.<p>天晚日落的时候，有人带着一切害病的和被鬼附的，来到耶稣跟前；</blockquote><p>可1:33<blockquote><p>The whole town gathered at the door,<p>合城的人都聚集在门前。</blockquote><p>可1:34<blockquote><p>and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.<p>耶稣治好了许多害各样病的人，又赶出许多鬼，不许鬼说话，因为鬼认识他。</blockquote><p>可1:35<blockquote><p>Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.<p>次日早晨，天未亮的时候，耶稣起来，到旷野地方去，在那里祷告。</blockquote><p>可1:36<blockquote><p>Simon and his companions went to look for him,<p>西门和同伴追了他去，</blockquote><p>可1:37<blockquote><p>and when they found him, they exclaimed: “Everyone is looking for you!”<p>遇见了就对他说：“众人都找你。”</blockquote><p>可1:38<blockquote><p>Jesus replied, “Let us go somewhere else–to the nearby villages–so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.”<p>耶稣对他们说：“我们可以往别处去，到邻近的乡村，我也好在那里传道，因为我是为这事出来的。”</blockquote><p>可1:39<blockquote><p>So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.<p>于是在加利利全地，进了会堂，传道，赶鬼。</blockquote><p>可1:40<blockquote><p>A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, “If you are willing, you can make me clean.”<p>有一个长大麻疯的来求耶稣，向他跪下，说：“你若肯，必能叫我洁净了！”</blockquote><p>可1:41<blockquote><p>Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!”<p>耶稣动了慈心，就伸手摸他，说：“我肯，你洁净了吧！”</blockquote><p>可1:42<blockquote><p>Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured.<p>大麻疯即时离开他，他就洁净了。</blockquote><p>可1:43<blockquote><p>Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:<p>耶稣严严地嘱咐他，就打发他走，</blockquote><p>可1:44<blockquote><p>“See that you don’t tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”<p>对他说：“你要谨慎，什么话都不可告诉人；只要去把身体给祭司察看，又因为你洁净了，献上摩西所吩咐的礼物，对众人作证据。”</blockquote><p>可1:45<blockquote><p>Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.<p>那人出去，倒说许多的话，把这件事传扬开了，叫耶稣以后不得再明明地进城，只好在外边旷野地方。人从各处都就了他来。</blockquote><h2 id="马可福音第2章">马可福音第2章</h2><p>可2:1<blockquote><p>A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home.<p>过了些日子，耶稣又进了迦百农。人听见他在房子里，</blockquote><p>可2:2<blockquote><p>So many gathered that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them.<p>就有许多人聚集，甚至连门前都没有空地，耶稣就对他们讲道。</blockquote><p>可2:3<blockquote><p>Some men came, bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them.<p>有人带着一个瘫子来见耶稣，是用四个人抬来的。</blockquote><p>可2:4<blockquote><p>Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on.<p>因为人多，不得近前，就把耶稣所在的房子，拆了房顶，既拆通了，就把瘫子连所躺卧的褥子都缒下来。</blockquote><p>可2:5<blockquote><p>When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”<p>耶稣见他们的信心，就对瘫子说：“小子，你的罪赦了。”</blockquote><p>可2:6<blockquote><p>Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,<p>有几个文士坐在那里，心里议论，说：</blockquote><p>可2:7<blockquote><p>“Why does this fellow talk like that? He’s blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”<p>“这个人为什么这样说呢？他说僭妄的话了！除了　神以外，谁能赦罪呢？”</blockquote><p>可2:8<blockquote><p>Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, “Why are you thinking these things?<p>耶稣心中知道他们心里这样议论，就说：“你们心里为什么这样议论呢？</blockquote><p>可2:9<blockquote><p>Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat and walk’?<p>或对瘫子说‘你的罪赦了’，或说‘起来，拿你的褥子行走’，哪一样容易呢？</blockquote><p>可2:10<blockquote><p>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. . . .” He said to the paralytic,<p>但要叫你们知道，人子在地上有赦罪的权柄。”就对瘫子说：</blockquote><p>可2:11<blockquote><p>“I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.”<p>“我吩咐你起来，拿你的褥子回家去吧！”</blockquote><p>可2:12<blockquote><p>He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”<p>那人就起来，立刻拿着褥子，当众人面前出去了。以致众人都惊奇，归荣耀与　神，说：“我们从来没有见过这样的事。”</blockquote><p>可2:13<blockquote><p>Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.<p>耶稣又出到海边去，众人都就了他来，他便教训他们。</blockquote><p>可2:14<blockquote><p>As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.<p>耶稣经过的时候，看见亚勒腓的儿子利未坐在税关上，就对他说：“你跟从我来！”他就起来，跟从了耶稣。</blockquote><p>可2:15<blockquote><p>While Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and “sinners” were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.<p>耶稣在利未家里坐席的时候，有好些税吏和罪人与耶稣并门徒一同坐席，因为这样的人多，他们也跟随耶稣。</blockquote><p>可2:16<blockquote><p>When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the “sinners” and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: “Why does he eat with tax collectors and ‘sinners’?”<p>法利赛人中的文士（有古卷作“文士和法利赛人”）看见耶稣和罪人并税吏一同吃饭，就对他门徒说：“他和税吏并罪人一同吃喝吗？”</blockquote><p>可2:17<blockquote><p>On hearing this, Jesus said to them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”<p>耶稣听见，就对他们说：“健康的人用不着医生，有病的人才用得着。我来本不是召义人，乃是召罪人。”</blockquote><p>可2:18<blockquote><p>Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, “How is it that John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?”<p>当下，约翰的门徒和法利赛人禁食。他们来问耶稣说：“约翰的门徒和法利赛人的门徒禁食，你的门徒倒不禁食，这是为什么呢？”</blockquote><p>可2:19<blockquote><p>Jesus answered, “How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them.<p>耶稣对他们说：“新郎和陪伴之人同在的时候，陪伴之人岂能禁食呢？新郎还同在，他们不能禁食。</blockquote><p>可2:20<blockquote><p>But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.<p>但日子将到，新郎要离开他们，那日他们就要禁食。</blockquote><p>可2:21<blockquote><p>“No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.<p>没有人把新布缝在旧衣服上，恐怕所补上的新布，带坏了旧衣服，破的就更大了。</blockquote><p>可2:22<blockquote><p>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins.

Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village.<p>他也诧异他们不信，就往周围乡村教训人去了。</blockquote><p>可6:7<blockquote><p>Calling the Twelve to him, he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits.<p>耶稣叫了十二个门徒来，差遣他们两个两个地出去，也赐给他们权柄，制伏污鬼，</blockquote><p>可6:8<blockquote><p>These were his instructions: “Take nothing for the journey except a staff–no bread, no bag, no money in your belts.<p>并且嘱咐他们：“行路的时候不要带食物和口袋，腰袋里也不要带钱，除了拐杖以外，什么都不要带；</blockquote><p>可6:9<blockquote><p>Wear sandals but not an extra tunic.<p>只要穿鞋，也不要穿两件褂子。”</blockquote><p>可6:10<blockquote><p>Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.<p>又对他们说：“你们无论到何处，进了人的家，就住在那里，直到离开那地方。</blockquote><p>可6:11<blockquote><p>And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave, as a testimony against them.”<p>何处的人不接待你们，不听你们，你们离开那里的时候，就把脚上的尘土跺下去，对他们作见证。”</blockquote><p>可6:12<blockquote><p>They went out and preached that people should repent.<p>门徒就出去传道，叫人悔改；</blockquote><p>可6:13<blockquote><p>They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.<p>又赶出许多的鬼，用油抹了许多病人，治好他们。</blockquote><p>可6:14<blockquote><p>King Herod heard about this, for Jesus’ name had become well known. Some were saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”<p>耶稣的名声传扬出来。希律王听见了，就说：“施洗的约翰从死里复活了，所以这些异能由他里面发出来。”</blockquote><p>可6:15<blockquote><p>Others said, “He is Elijah.” And still others claimed, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago.”<p>但别人说：“是以利亚。”又有人说：“是先知，正像先知中的一位。”</blockquote><p>可6:16<blockquote><p>But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, the man I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!”<p>希律听见却说：“是我所斩的约翰，他复活了。”</blockquote><p>可6:17<blockquote><p>For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, whom he had married.<p>先是希律为他兄弟腓力的妻子希罗底的缘故，差人去拿住约翰，锁在监里；因为希律已经娶了那妇人。</blockquote><p>可6:18<blockquote><p>For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”<p>约翰曾对希律说：“你娶你兄弟的妻子是不合理的。”</blockquote><p>可6:19<blockquote><p>So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to,<p>于是希罗底怀恨他，想要杀他，只是不能。</blockquote><p>可6:20<blockquote><p>because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled; yet he liked to listen to him.<p>因为希律知道约翰是义人，是圣人，所以敬畏他，保护他，听他讲论，就多照着行（有古卷作“游移不定”），并且乐意听他。</blockquote><p>可6:21<blockquote><p>Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.<p>有一天，恰巧是希律的生日，希律摆设筵席，请了大臣和千夫长，并加利利作首领的。</blockquote><p>可6:22<blockquote><p>When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, “Ask me for anything you want, and I’ll give it to you.”<p>希罗底的女儿进来跳舞，使希律和同席的人都欢喜。王就对女子说：“你随意向我求什么，我必给你。”</blockquote><p>可6:23<blockquote><p>And he promised her with an oath, “Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.”<p>又对她起誓说：“随你向我求什么，就是我国的一半，我也必给你！”</blockquote><p>可6:24<blockquote><p>She went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask for?” “The head of John the Baptist,” she answered.<p>她就出去对她母亲说：“我可以求什么呢？”她母亲说：“施洗约翰的头！”</blockquote><p>可6:25<blockquote><p>At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”<p>她就急忙进去见王，求他说：“我愿王立时把施洗约翰的头放在盘子里给我。”</blockquote><p>可6:26<blockquote><p>The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.<p>王就甚忧愁，但因他所起的誓，又因同席的人，就不肯推辞，</blockquote><p>可6:27<blockquote><p>So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John’s head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison,<p>随即差一个护卫兵，吩咐拿约翰的头来。护卫兵就去，在监里斩了约翰，</blockquote><p>可6:28<blockquote><p>and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.<p>把头放在盘子里，拿来给女子，女子就给她母亲。</blockquote><p>可6:29<blockquote><p>On hearing of this, John’s disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.<p>约翰的门徒听见了，就来把他的尸首领去，葬在坟墓里。</blockquote><p>可6:30<blockquote><p>The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught.<p>使徒聚集到耶稣那里，将一切所做的事，所传的道全告诉他。</blockquote><p>可6:31<blockquote><p>Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, “Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.”<p>他就说：“你们来，同我暗暗地到旷野地方去歇一歇。”这是因为来往的人多，他们连吃饭也没有工夫。</blockquote><p>可6:32<blockquote><p>So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.<p>他们就坐船，暗暗地往旷野地方去。</blockquote><p>可6:33<blockquote><p>But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.<p>众人看见他们去，有许多认识他们的，就从各城步行，一同跑到那里，比他们先赶到了。</blockquote><p>可6:34<blockquote><p>When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.<p>耶稣出来，见有许多的人，就怜悯他们，因为他们如同羊没有牧人一般，于是开口教训他们许多道理。</blockquote><p>可6:35<blockquote><p>By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. “This is a remote place,” they said, “and it’s already very late.<p>天已经晚了，门徒进前来，说：“这是野地，天已经晚了，</blockquote><p>可6:36<blockquote><p>Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”<p>请叫众人散开，他们好往四面乡村里去，自己买什么吃。”</blockquote><p>可6:37<blockquote><p>But he answered, “You give them something to eat.” They said to him, “That would take eight months of a man’s wages! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?”<p>耶稣回答说：“你们给他们吃吧！”门徒说：“我们可以去买二十两银子的饼，给他们吃吗？”</blockquote><p>可6:38<blockquote><p>“How many loaves do you have?” he asked. “Go and see.” When they found out, they said, “Five–and two fish.”<p>耶稣说：“你们有多少饼，可以去看看。”他们知道了，就说：“五个饼，两条鱼。”</blockquote><p>可6:39<blockquote><p>Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.<p>耶稣吩咐他们，叫众人一帮一帮地坐在青草地上。</blockquote><p>可6:40<blockquote><p>So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.<p>众人就一排一排地坐下，有一百一排的，有五十一排的。</blockquote><p>可6:41<blockquote><p>Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.<p>耶稣拿着这五个饼，两条鱼，望着天祝福，掰开饼，递给门徒，摆在众人面前，也把那两条鱼分给众人。</blockquote><p>可6:42<blockquote><p>They all ate and were satisfied,<p>他们都吃，并且吃饱了。</blockquote><p>可6:43<blockquote><p>and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish.<p>门徒就把碎饼碎鱼收拾起来，装满了十二个篮子。</blockquote><p>可6:44<blockquote><p>The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.<p>吃饼的男人共有五千。</blockquote><p>可6:45<blockquote><p>Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.<p>耶稣随即催门徒上船，先渡到那边伯赛大去，等他叫众人散开。</blockquote><p>可6:46<blockquote><p>After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.<p>他既辞别了他们，就往山上去祷告。</blockquote><p>可6:47<blockquote><p>When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land.<p>到了晚上，船在海中，耶稣独自在岸上，</blockquote><p>可6:48<blockquote><p>He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them,<p>看见门徒因风不顺，摇橹甚苦。夜里约有四更天，就在海面上走，往他们那里去，意思要走过他们去。</blockquote><p>可6:49<blockquote><p>but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out,<p>但门徒看见他在海面上走，以为是鬼怪，就喊叫起来。</blockquote><p>可6:50<blockquote><p>because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and said, “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”<p>因为他们都看见了他，且甚惊慌。耶稣连忙对他们说：“你们放心，是我，不要怕！”</blockquote><p>可6:51<blockquote><p>Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed,<p>于是到他们那里上了船，风就住了，他们心里十分惊奇。</blockquote><p>可6:52<blockquote><p>for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.<p>这是因为他们不明白那分饼的事，心里还是愚顽。</blockquote><p>可6:53<blockquote><p>When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there.<p>既渡过去，来到革尼撒勒地方，就靠了岸，</blockquote><p>可6:54<blockquote><p>As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus.<p>一下船，众人认得是耶稣，</blockquote><p>可6:55<blockquote><p>They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.<p>就跑遍那一带地方，听见他在何处，便将有病的人用褥子抬到那里。</blockquote><p>可6:56<blockquote><p>And wherever he went–into villages, towns or countryside–they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were healed.<p>凡耶稣所到的地方，或村中，或城里，或乡间，他们都将病人放在街市上，求耶稣只容他们摸他的衣裳穗子，凡摸着的人就都好了。</blockquote><h2 id="马可福音第7章">马可福音第7章</h2><p>可7:1<blockquote><p>The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and<p>有法利赛人和几个文士从耶路撒冷来，到耶稣那里聚集。</blockquote><p>可7:2<blockquote><p>saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were “unclean,” that is, unwashed.<p>他们曾看见他的门徒中有人用俗手，就是没有洗的手吃饭。</blockquote><p>可7:3<blockquote><p>(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders.<p>（原来法利赛人和犹太人都拘守古人的遗传，若不仔细洗手就不吃饭；</blockquote><p>可7:4<blockquote><p>When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash.

Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.<p>约瑟买了细麻布，把耶稣取下来，用细麻布裹好，安放在磐石中凿出来的坟墓里，又滚过一块石头来挡住墓门。</blockquote><p>可15:47<blockquote><p>Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.<p>抹大拉的马利亚和约西的母亲马利亚都看见安放他的地方。</blockquote><h2 id="马可福音第16章">马可福音第16章</h2><p>可16:1<blockquote><p>When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus’ body.<p>过了安息日，抹大拉的马利亚和雅各的母亲马利亚并撒罗米，买了香膏要去膏耶稣的身体。</blockquote><p>可16:2<blockquote><p>Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb<p>七日的第一日清早，出太阳的时候，她们来到坟墓那里，</blockquote><p>可16:3<blockquote><p>and they asked each other, “Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?”<p>彼此说：“谁给我们把石头从墓门滚开呢？”</blockquote><p>可16:4<blockquote><p>But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away.<p>那石头原来很大，她们抬头一看，却见石头已经滚开了。</blockquote><p>可16:5<blockquote><p>As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.<p>她们进了坟墓，看见一个少年人坐在右边，穿着白袍，就甚惊恐。</blockquote><p>可16:6<blockquote><p>“Don’t be alarmed,” he said. “You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him.<p>那少年人对她们说：“不要惊恐，你们寻找那钉十字架的拿撒勒人耶稣，他已经复活了，不在这里。请看安放他的地方。</blockquote><p>可16:7<blockquote><p>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.’”<p>你们可以去告诉他的门徒和彼得，说：‘他在你们以先往加利利去。在那里你们要见他，正如他从前所告诉你们的。’”</blockquote><p>可16:8<blockquote><p>Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.<p>她们就出来，从坟墓那里逃跑，又发抖又惊奇，什么也不告诉人，因为她们害怕。</blockquote><p>可16:9<blockquote><p>The most reliable early manuscripts and other ancient witnesses do not have Mark 16:9-20. When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons.<p>在七日的第一日清早，耶稣复活了，就先向抹大拉的马利亚显现；耶稣从她身上曾赶出七个鬼。</blockquote><p>可16:10<blockquote><p>She went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping.<p>她去告诉那向来跟随耶稣的人，那时他们正哀恸哭泣。</blockquote><p>可16:11<blockquote><p>When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it.<p>他们听见耶稣活了，被马利亚看见，却是不信。</blockquote><p>可16:12<blockquote><p>Afterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country.<p>这事以后，门徒中间有两个人往乡下去。走路的时候，耶稣变了形像，向他们显现。</blockquote><p>可16:13<blockquote><p>These returned and reported it to the rest; but they did not believe them either.<p>他们就去告诉其余的门徒，其余的门徒也是不信。</blockquote><p>可16:14<blockquote><p>Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen.<p>后来，十一个门徒坐席的时候，耶稣向他们显现，责备他们不信，心里刚硬，因为他们不信那些在他复活以后看见他的人。</blockquote><p>可16:15<blockquote><p>He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation.<p>他又对他们说：“你们往普天下去，传福音给万民（“万民”原文作“凡受造的”）听。</blockquote><p>可16:16<blockquote><p>Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.<p>信而受洗的，必然得救；不信的，必被定罪。</blockquote><p>可16:17<blockquote><p>And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;<p>信的人必有神迹随着他们：就是奉我的名赶鬼，说新方言，</blockquote><p>可16:18<blockquote><p>they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.”<p>手能拿蛇，若喝了什么毒物，也必不受害，手按病人，病人就必好了。”</blockquote><p>可16:19<blockquote><p>After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God.<p>主耶稣和他们说完了话，后来被接到天上，坐在　神的右边。</blockquote><p>可16:20<blockquote><p>Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it.<p>门徒出去，到处宣传福音。主和他们同工，用神迹随着，证实所传的道。阿们。</blockquote></article><footer role="contentinfo"><hr/><p><small class="copyright">© Seon Zhu 2022.
