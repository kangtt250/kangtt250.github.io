## 腓利门书第1章
门1:1
> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker,
>
> 为基督耶稣被囚的保罗同兄弟提摩太，写信给我们所亲爱的同工腓利门，


门1:2
> to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home:
>
> 和妹子亚腓亚，并与我们同当兵的亚基布，以及在你家的教会：


门1:3
> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
>
> 愿恩惠、平安从　神我们的父和主耶稣基督归与你们！


门1:4
> I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,
>
> 我祷告的时候提到你，常为你感谢我的　神，


门1:5
> because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.
>
> 因听说你的爱心并你向主耶稣和众圣徒的信心（或作“因听说你向主耶稣和众圣徒有爱心、有信心”）。


门1:6
> I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ.
>
> 愿你与人所同有的信心显出功效，使人知道你们各样善事都是为基督做的。


门1:7
> Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.
>
> 兄弟啊，我为你的爱心大有快乐，大得安慰，因众圣徒的心从你得了畅快。


门1:8
> Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,
>
> 我虽然靠着基督能放胆吩咐你合宜的事，


门1:9
> yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as Paul--an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus--
>
> 然而像我这有年纪的保罗，现在又是为基督耶稣被囚的，宁可凭着爱心求你，


门1:10
> I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, who became my son while I was in chains.
>
> 就是为我在捆锁中所生的儿子阿尼西谋（此名就是“有益处”的意思）求你。


门1:11
> Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.
>
> 他从前与你没有益处，但如今与你我都有益处。


门1:12
> I am sending him--who is my very heart--back to you.
>
> 我现在打发他亲自回你那里去，他是我心上的人。


门1:13
> I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.
>
> 我本来有意将他留下，在我为福音所受的捆锁中替你伺候我；


门1:14
> But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do will be spontaneous and not forced.
>
> 但不知道你的意思，我就不愿意这样行，叫你的善行不是出于勉强，乃是出于甘心。


门1:15
> Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for good--
>
> 他暂时离开你，或者是叫你永远得着他；


门1:16
> no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.
>
> 不再是奴仆，乃是高过奴仆，是亲爱的兄弟。在我实在是如此，何况在你呢！这也不拘是按肉体说，是按主说。


门1:17
> So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.
>
> 你若以我为同伴，就收纳他，如同收纳我一样。


门1:18
> If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.
>
> 他若亏负你，或欠你什么，都归在我的账上，


门1:19
> I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back--not to mention that you owe me your very self.
>
> 我必偿还。这是我保罗亲笔写的。我并不用对你说，连你自己也是亏欠于我。


门1:20
> I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.
>
> 兄弟啊，望你使我在主里因你得快乐（或作“益处”），并望你使我的心在基督里得畅快。


门1:21
> Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.
>
> 我写信给你，深信你必顺服，知道你所要行的，必过于我所说的。


门1:22
> And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.
>
> 此外，你还要给我预备住处，因为我盼望借着你们的祷告，必蒙恩到你们那里去。


门1:23
> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.
>
> 为基督耶稣与我同坐监的以巴弗问你安。


门1:24
> And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.
>
> 与我同工的马可、亚里达古、底马、路加也都问你安。


门1:25
> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
>
> 愿我们主耶稣基督的恩常在你的心里。阿们。
