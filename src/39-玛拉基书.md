>
> 以东人说：“我们现在虽被毁坏，却要重建荒废之处。”万军之耶和华如此说：“任他们建造，我必拆毁。人必称他们的地为‘罪恶之境’；称他们的民为耶和华永远恼怒之民。


玛1:5
> You will see it with your own eyes and say, 'Great is the LORD--even beyond the borders of Israel!'

>
> 藐视我名的祭司啊，万军之耶和华对你们说：儿子尊敬父亲，仆人敬畏主人；我既为父亲，尊敬我的在哪里呢？我既为主人，敬畏我的在哪里呢？“你们却说：‘我们在何事上藐视你的名呢？’

> 你们将污秽的食物献在我的坛上，且说：‘我们在何事上污秽你呢？’因你们说，耶和华的桌子是可藐视的。


玛1:8
> When you bring blind animals for sacrifice, is that not wrong? When you sacrifice crippled or diseased animals, is that not wrong? Try offering them to your governor! Would he be pleased with you? Would he accept you?" says the LORD Almighty.
>
> 你们将瞎眼的献为祭物，这不为恶吗？将瘸腿的、有病的献上，这不为恶吗？你献给你的省长，他岂喜悦你，岂能看你的情面吗？”这是万军之耶和华说的。

> And you say, 'What a burden!' and you sniff at it contemptuously," says the LORD Almighty. "When you bring injured, crippled or diseased animals and offer them as sacrifices, should I accept them from your hands?" says the LORD.
>
> 你们又说：‘这些事何等烦琐！’并嗤之以鼻。”这是万军之耶和华说的。“你们把抢夺的、瘸腿的、有病的拿来献上为祭。我岂能从你们手中收纳呢？”这是耶和华说的。


玛1:14

>
> 你们就知道我传这诫命给你们，使我与利未（或作“利未人”）所立的约可以常存。这是万军之耶和华说的。


玛2:5
> "My covenant was with him, a covenant of life and peace, and I gave them to him; this called for reverence and he revered me and stood in awe of my name.
>
> 我曾与他立生命和平安的约，我将这两样赐给他，使他存敬畏的心；他就敬畏我，惧怕我的名。

> True instruction was in his mouth and nothing false was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many from sin.
>
> 真实的律法在他口中，他嘴里没有不义的话。他以平安和正直与我同行，使多人回头离开罪孽。


玛2:7
> "For the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge, and from his mouth men should seek instruction--because he is the messenger of the LORD Almighty.
>
> 祭司的嘴里当存知识，人也当由他口中寻求律法，因为他是万军之耶和华的使者。

>
> 你们却偏离正道，使许多人在律法上跌倒；你们废弃我与利未所立的约。”这是万军之耶和华说的。


玛2:9
> "So I have caused you to be despised and humiliated before all the people, because you have not followed my ways but have shown partiality in matters of the law."
>
> “所以我使你们被众人藐视，看为下贱，因你们不守我的道，竟在律法上瞻徇情面。”


玛2:10
> Have we not all one Father? Did not one God create us? Why do we profane the covenant of our fathers by breaking faith with one another?
>
> 我们岂不都是一位父吗？岂不是一位　神所造的吗？我们各人怎么以诡诈待弟兄，背弃了　神与我们列祖所立的约呢？


玛2:11
> Judah has broken faith. A detestable thing has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem: Judah has desecrated the sanctuary the LORD loves, by marrying the daughter of a foreign god.
>
> 犹大人行事诡诈，并且在以色列和耶路撒冷中行一件可憎的事。因为犹大人亵渎耶和华所喜爱的圣洁（或作“圣地”），娶侍奉外邦　神的女子为妻。


玛2:12
> As for the man who does this, whoever he may be, may the LORD cut him off from the tents of Jacob--even though he brings offerings to the LORD Almighty.
>
> 凡行这事的，无论何人（“何人”原文作“叫醒的、答应的”），就是献供物给万军之耶和华，耶和华也必从雅各的帐棚中剪除他。


玛2:13
> Another thing you do: You flood the LORD'S altar with tears. You weep and wail because he no longer pays attention to your offerings or accepts them with pleasure from your hands.
>
> 你们又行了一件这样的事，使前妻叹息哭泣的眼泪遮盖耶和华的坛，以致耶和华不再看顾那供物，也不乐意从你们手中收纳。


玛2:14
> You ask, "Why?" It is because the LORD is acting as the witness between you and the wife of your youth, because you have broken faith with her, though she is your partner, the wife of your marriage covenant.
>
> 你们还说：“这是为什么呢？”因耶和华在你和你幼年所娶的妻中间作见证。她虽是你的配偶，又是你盟约的妻，你却以诡诈待她。


玛2:15
> Has not the LORD made them one? In flesh and spirit they are his. And why one? Because he was seeking godly offspring. So guard yourself in your spirit, and do not break faith with the wife of your youth.
>
> 虽然　神有灵的余力能造多人，他不是单造一人吗？为何只造一人呢？乃是他愿人得虔诚的后裔。所以当谨守你们的心，谁也不可以诡诈待幼年所娶的妻。


玛2:16
> "I hate divorce," says the LORD God of Israel, "and I hate a man's covering himself with violence as well as with his garment," says the LORD Almighty. So guard yourself in your spirit, and do not break faith.
>
> 耶和华以色列的　神说：“休妻的事和以强暴待妻的人，都是我所恨恶的。所以当谨守你们的心，不可行诡诈。这是万军之耶和华说的。”


玛2:17
> You have wearied the LORD with your words. "How have we wearied him?" you ask. By saying, "All who do evil are good in the eyes of the LORD, and he is pleased with them" or "Where is the God of justice?"
>
> 你们用言语烦琐耶和华，你们还说：“我们在何事上烦琐他呢？”因为你们说：“凡行恶的，耶和华眼看为善，并且他喜悦他们。”或说：“公义的　神在哪里呢？”


## 玛拉基书第3章

>
> 万军之耶和华说：“我必临近你们，施行审判。我必速速作见证，警戒行邪术的、犯奸淫的、起假誓的、亏负人之工价的、欺压寡妇孤儿的、屈枉寄居的和不敬畏我的。

>
> 因你们通国的人都夺取我的供物，咒诅就临到你们身上。”


玛3:10
> Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this," says the LORD Almighty, "and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that you will not have room enough for it.
>
> 万军之耶和华说：“你们要将当纳的十分之一全然送入仓库，使我家有粮，以此试试我是否为你们敞开天上的窗户，倾福与你们，甚至无处可容。”
