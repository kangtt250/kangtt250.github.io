> “耶和华曾向你们列祖大大发怒。


亚1:3
> Therefore tell the people: This is what the LORD Almighty says: 'Return to me,' declares the LORD Almighty, 'and I will return to you,' says the LORD Almighty.
>
> 所以你要对以色列人说：万军之耶和华如此说：‘你们要转向我，我就转向你们。’这是万军之耶和华说的。


亚1:4
> Do not be like your forefathers, to whom the earlier prophets proclaimed: This is what the LORD Almighty says: 'Turn from your evil ways and your evil practices.' But they would not listen or pay attention to me, declares the LORD.
>
> 不要效法你们列祖。从前的先知呼叫他们说：万军之耶和华如此说：‘你们要回头离开你们的恶道恶行！’他们却不听，也不顺从我。这是耶和华说的。


亚1:5
> Where are your forefathers now? And the prophets, do they live forever?
>
> 你们的列祖在哪里呢？那些先知能永远存活吗？


亚1:6
> But did not my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, overtake your forefathers? "Then they repented and said, 'The LORD Almighty has done to us what our ways and practices deserve, just as he determined to do.'"
>
> 只是我的言语和律例，就是所吩咐我仆人众先知的，岂不临到你们列祖吗？“他们就回头说：‘万军之耶和华定意按我们的行动作为向我们怎样行，他已照样行了。’”


亚1:7

> During the night I had a vision--and there before me was a man riding a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in a ravine. Behind him were red, brown and white horses.
>
> “我夜间观看，见一人骑着红马，站在洼地番石榴树中间。在他身后，又有红马、黄马和白马。”


亚1:9
> I asked, "What are these, my lord?" The angel who was talking with me answered, "I will show you what they are."
>
> 我对与我说话的天使说：“主啊，这是什么意思？”他说：“我要指示你这是什么意思。”


亚1:10
> Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, "They are the ones the LORD has sent to go throughout the earth."
>
> 那站在番石榴树中间的人说：“这是奉耶和华差遣，在遍地走来走去的。”


亚1:11
> And they reported to the angel of the LORD, who was standing among the myrtle trees, "We have gone throughout the earth and found the whole world at rest and in peace."
>
> 那些骑马的对站在番石榴树中间耶和华的使者说：“我们已在遍地走来走去，见全地都安息平静。”


亚1:12
> Then the angel of the LORD said, "LORD Almighty, how long will you withhold mercy from Jerusalem and from the towns of Judah, which you have been angry with these seventy years?"
>
> 于是，耶和华的使者说：“万军之耶和华啊，你恼恨耶路撒冷和犹大的城邑已经七十年，你不施怜悯要到几时呢？”


亚1:13
> So the LORD spoke kind and comforting words to the angel who talked with me.
>
> 耶和华就用美善的安慰话回答那与我说话的天使。


亚1:14
> Then the angel who was speaking to me said, "Proclaim this word: This is what the LORD Almighty says: 'I am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion,
>
> 与我说话的天使对我说：“你要宣告说：万军之耶和华如此说：‘我为耶路撒冷、为锡安，心里极其火热。


亚1:15
> but I am very angry with the nations that feel secure. I was only a little angry, but they added to the calamity.'
>
> 我甚恼怒那安逸的列国。因我从前稍微恼怒我民，他们就加害过分。’


亚1:16
> "Therefore, this is what the LORD says: 'I will return to Jerusalem with mercy, and there my house will be rebuilt. And the measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem,' declares the LORD Almighty.
>
> “所以耶和华如此说：‘现今我回到耶路撒冷，仍施怜悯。我的殿必重建在其中，准绳必拉在耶路撒冷之上。’这是万军之耶和华说的。


亚1:17
> "Proclaim further: This is what the LORD Almighty says: 'My towns will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.'"
>
> “你要再宣告说：万军之耶和华如此说：‘我的城邑必再丰盛发达。耶和华必再安慰锡安，拣选耶路撒冷。’”

>
> 我举目观看，见有四角。


亚1:19
> I asked the angel who was speaking to me, "What are these?" He answered me, "These are the horns that scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem."
>
> 我就问与我说话的天使说：“这是什么意思？”他回答说：“这是打散犹大、以色列和耶路撒冷的角。”


亚1:20
> Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen.
>
> 耶和华又指四个匠人给我看。


亚1:21
> I asked, "What are these coming to do?" He answered, "These are the horns that scattered Judah so that no one could raise his head, but the craftsmen have come to terrify them and throw down these horns of the nations who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter its people."
>
> 我说：“他们来做什么呢？”他说：“这是打散犹大的角，使人不敢抬头；但这些匠人来威吓列国，打掉他们的角，就是举起打散犹大地的角。”
