> Then the commander said, "I had to pay a big price for my citizenship." "But I was born a citizen," Paul replied.
>
> 千夫长说：“我用许多银子，才入了罗马的民籍。”保罗说：“我生来就是。”


徒22:29
> Those who were about to question him withdrew immediately. The commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put Paul, a Roman citizen, in chains.
>

徒23:1
> Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said, "My brothers, I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day."
>
> 保罗定睛看着公会的人，说：“弟兄们，我在　神面前行事为人都是凭着良心，直到今日。”


徒23:2

>
> 大祭司亚拿尼亚就吩咐旁边站着的人打他的嘴。


徒23:3
> Then Paul said to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck!"
>
> 保罗对他说：“你这粉饰的墙，　神要打你！你坐堂为的是按律法审问我，你竟违背律法，吩咐人打我吗？”

>
> 站在旁边的人说：“你辱骂　神的大祭司吗？”


徒23:5
> Paul replied, "Brothers, I did not realize that he was the high priest; for it is written: 'Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.'"

> 保罗说：“弟兄们，我不晓得他是大祭司。经上记着说：‘不可毁谤你百姓的官长。’”


徒23:6
> Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin, "My brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee. I stand on trial because of my hope in the resurrection of the dead."
>
> 保罗看出大众一半是撒都该人，一半是法利赛人，就在公会中大声说：“弟兄们，我是法利赛人，也是法利赛人的子孙。我现在受审问，是为盼望死人复活。”


徒23:7
> When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
>
> 说了这话，法利赛人和撒都该人就争论起来，会众分为两党。


徒23:8
> (The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, and that there are neither angels nor spirits, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.)
>
> 因为撒都该人说没有复活，也没有天使和鬼魂；法利赛人却说两样都有，


徒23:9
> There was a great uproar, and some of the teachers of the law who were Pharisees stood up and argued vigorously. "We find nothing wrong with this man," they said. "What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?"
>
> 于是大大地喧嚷起来。有几个法利赛党的文士站起来争辩说：“我们看不出这人有什么恶处，倘若有鬼魂或是天使对他说过话，怎么样呢？”


徒23:10
> The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them. He ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force and bring him into the barracks.
>
> 那时大起争吵，千夫长恐怕保罗被他们扯碎了，就吩咐兵丁下去，把他从众人当中抢出来，带进营楼去。

>
> 保罗的外甥听见他们设下埋伏，就来到营楼里告诉保罗。


徒23:17

>
> 保罗请一个百夫长来，说：“你领这少年人去见千夫长，他有事告诉他。”


徒23:18
> So he took him to the commander. The centurion said, "Paul, the prisoner, sent for me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you."
>
> 于是把他领去见千夫长，说：“被囚的保罗请我到他那里，求我领这少年人来见你，他有事告诉你。”

> The commander took the young man by the hand, drew him aside and asked, "What is it you want to tell me?"
>
> 千夫长就拉着他的手，走到一旁，私下问他说：“你有什么事告诉我呢？”


徒23:20
> He said: "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul before the Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about him.
>
> 他说：“犹太人已经约定，要求你明天带下保罗到公会里去，假作要详细查问他的事。


徒23:21
> Don't give in to them, because more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now, waiting for your consent to their request."
>
> 你切不要随从他们，因为他们有四十多人埋伏，已经起誓说，若不先杀保罗，就不吃不喝。现在预备好了，只等你应允。”


徒23:22
> The commander dismissed the young man and cautioned him, "Don't tell anyone that you have reported this to me."
>
> 于是千夫长打发少年人走，嘱咐他说：“不要告诉人你将这事报给我了。”


徒23:23
> Then he called two of his centurions and ordered them, "Get ready a detachment of two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at nine tonight.
>
> 千夫长便叫了两个百夫长来，说：“预备步兵二百，马兵七十，长枪手二百，今夜亥初往凯撒利亚去；


徒23:24
> Provide mounts for Paul so that he may be taken safely to Governor Felix."
>
> 也要预备牲口叫保罗骑上，护送到巡抚腓力斯那里去。”


徒23:25
> He wrote a letter as follows:
>
> 千夫长又写了文书，


徒23:26
> Claudius Lysias, To His Excellency, Governor Felix: Greetings.
>
> 大略说：革老丢吕西亚请巡抚腓力斯大人安。

徒27:42
> The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping.
>
> 兵丁的意思要把囚犯杀了，恐怕有凫水脱逃的。
