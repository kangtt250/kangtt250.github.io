>
> 彼此揪头，用刀刺肋，一同仆倒。所以那地叫作希利甲哈素林，就在基遍。

>
> 那日的战事凶猛，押尼珥和以色列人败在大卫的仆人面前。

撒下2:21
> Then Abner said to him, "Turn aside to the right or to the left; take on one of the young men and strip him of his weapons." But Asahel would not stop chasing him.
>
> 押尼珥对他说：“你或转向左，转向右，拿住一个少年人，剥去他的战衣。”亚撒黑却不肯转开不追赶他。


撒下2:22
> Again Abner warned Asahel, "Stop chasing me! Why should I strike you down? How could I look your brother Joab in the face?"
>
> 押尼珥又对亚撒黑说：“你转开不追赶我吧！我何必杀你呢？若杀你，有什么脸见你哥哥约押呢？”


撒下2:23
> But Asahel refused to give up the pursuit; so Abner thrust the butt of his spear into Asahel's stomach, and the spear came out through his back. He fell there and died on the spot. And every man stopped when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died.
>
> 亚撒黑仍不肯转开，故此押尼珥就用枪尾刺入他的肚腹，甚至枪从背后透出。亚撒黑就在那里仆倒而死。众人赶到亚撒黑仆倒而死的地方，就都站住。


撒下2:24
> But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and as the sun was setting, they came to the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the way to the wasteland of Gibeon.
>
> 约押和亚比筛追赶押尼珥，日落的时候，到了通基遍旷野的路旁，基亚对面的亚玛山。


撒下2:25
> Then the men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner. They formed themselves into a group and took their stand on top of a hill.
>
> 便雅悯人聚集，跟随押尼珥站在一个山顶上。


撒下2:26
> Abner called out to Joab, "Must the sword devour forever? Don't you realize that this will end in bitterness? How long before you order your men to stop pursuing their brothers?"
>
> 押尼珥呼叫约押说：“刀剑岂可永远杀人吗？你岂不知终久必有苦楚吗？你要等何时才叫百姓回去，不追赶弟兄呢？”


撒下2:27
> Joab answered, "As surely as God lives, if you had not spoken, the men would have continued the pursuit of their brothers until morning."
>
> 约押说：“我指着永生的　神起誓，你若不说戏耍的那句话，今日早晨百姓就回去，不追赶弟兄了。”


撒下2:28
> So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the men came to a halt; they no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight anymore.
>
> 于是约押吹角，众民就站住，不再追赶以色列人，也不再打仗了。


撒下2:29
> All that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, continued through the whole Bithron and came to Mahanaim.
>
> 押尼珥和跟随他的人整夜经过亚拉巴，过约旦河走过毕伦，到了玛哈念。


撒下2:30
> Then Joab returned from pursuing Abner and assembled all his men. Besides Asahel, nineteen of David's men were found missing.
>
> 约押追赶押尼珥回来，聚集众民，见大卫的仆人中缺少了十九个人和亚撒黑。


撒下2:31
> But David's men had killed three hundred and sixty Benjamites who were with Abner.
>
> 但大卫的仆人杀了便雅悯人和跟随押尼珥的人，共三百六十名。


撒下2:32

> The king asked Ziba, "Why have you brought these?" Ziba answered, "The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on, the bread and fruit are for the men to eat, and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the desert."
>
> 王问洗巴说：“你带这些来是什么意思呢？”洗巴说：“驴是给王的家眷骑的；面饼和夏天的果饼是给少年人吃的；酒是给在旷野疲乏人喝的。”


撒下16:3
> The king then asked, "Where is your master's grandson?" Ziba said to him, "He is staying in Jerusalem, because he thinks, 'Today the house of Israel will give me back my grandfather's kingdom.'"
>
> 王问说：“你主人的儿子在哪里呢？”洗巴回答王说：“他仍在耶路撒冷，因他说：‘以色列人今日必将我父的国归还我。’”

>
> 示每咒骂说：“你这流人血的坏人哪，去吧，去吧！


撒下16:8
> The LORD has repaid you for all the blood you shed in the household of Saul, in whose place you have reigned. The LORD has handed the kingdom over to your son Absalom. You have come to ruin because you are a man of blood!"
>
> 你流扫罗全家的血，接续他作王，耶和华把这罪归在你身上，将这国交给你儿子押沙龙。现在你自取其祸，因为你是流人血的人。”

> 洗鲁雅的儿子亚比筛对王说：“这死狗岂可咒骂我主我王呢？求你容我过去，割下他的头来”


撒下16:10
> But the king said, "What do you and I have in common, you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the LORD said to him, 'Curse David,' who can ask, 'Why do you do this?'"
>
> 王说：“洗鲁雅的儿子，我与你们有何关涉呢？他咒骂，是因耶和华吩咐他说：‘你要咒骂大卫。’如此，谁敢说你为什么这样行呢？”


撒下16:11
> David then said to Abishai and all his officials, "My son, who is of my own flesh, is trying to take my life. How much more, then, this Benjamite! Leave him alone; let him curse, for the LORD has told him to.
>
> 大卫又对亚比筛和众臣仆说：“我亲生的儿子尚且寻索我的性命，何况这便雅悯人呢？由他咒骂吧！因为这是耶和华吩咐他的。


撒下16:12
> It may be that the LORD will see my distress and repay me with good for the cursing I am receiving today."
>
> 或者耶和华见我遭难，为我今日被这人咒骂，就施恩与我。”


撒下16:13
> So David and his men continued along the road while Shimei was going along the hillside opposite him, cursing as he went and throwing stones at him and showering him with dirt.
>
> 于是，大卫和跟随他的人往前行走。示每在大卫对面山坡，一面行走一面咒骂，又拿石头砍他，拿土扬他。


撒下16:14
> The king and all the people with him arrived at their destination exhausted. And there he refreshed himself.
>
> 王和跟随他的众人，疲疲乏乏地到了一个地方，就在那里歇息歇息。

撒下16:20
> Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give us your advice. What should we do?"
>
> 押沙龙对亚希多弗说：“你们出个主意，我们怎样行才好？”


撒下16:21
> Ahithophel answered, "Lie with your father's concubines whom he left to take care of the palace. Then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself a stench in your father's nostrils, and the hands of everyone with you will be strengthened."
>
> 亚希多弗对押沙龙说：“你父所留下看守宫殿的妃嫔，你可以与她们亲近。以色列众人听见你父亲憎恶你，凡归顺你人的手，就更坚强。”


撒下16:22
> So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he lay with his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
>
> 于是人为押沙龙在宫殿的平顶上支搭帐棚。押沙龙在以色列众人眼前，与他父的妃嫔亲近。


撒下16:23
> Now in those days the advice Ahithophel gave was like that of one who inquires of God. That was how both David and Absalom regarded all of Ahithophel's advice.
>
> 那时，亚希多弗所出的主意，好像人问　神的话一样，他昔日给大卫，今日给押沙龙所出的主意，都是这样。

>
> 亚希多弗又对押沙龙说：“求你准我挑选一万二千人，今夜我就起身追赶大卫。


撒下17:2
> I would attack him while he is weary and weak. I would strike him with terror, and then all the people with him will flee. I would strike down only the king
>
> 趁他疲乏手软，我忽然追上他，使他惊惶。跟随他的民必都逃跑，我就单杀王一人，


撒下17:3
> and bring all the people back to you. The death of the man you seek will mean the return of all; all the people will be unharmed."
>
> 使众民都归顺你。你所寻找的人既然死了，众民就如已经归顺你。这样，也都平安无事了。”


撒下17:4
> This plan seemed good to Absalom and to all the elders of Israel.

撒下17:5
> But Absalom said, "Summon also Hushai the Arkite, so we can hear what he has to say."
>
> 押沙龙说：“要召亚基人户筛来，我们也要听他怎样说。”


撒下17:6

撒下17:7
> Hushai replied to Absalom, "The advice Ahithophel has given is not good this time.
>
> 户筛对押沙龙说：“亚希多弗这次所定的谋不善。”


撒下17:8
> You know your father and his men; they are fighters, and as fierce as a wild bear robbed of her cubs. Besides, your father is an experienced fighter; he will not spend the night with the troops.
>
> 户筛又说：“你知道，你父亲和跟随他的人都是勇士，现在他们心里恼怒，如同田野丢崽子的母熊一般；而且你父亲是个战士，必不和民一同住宿。


撒下17:9
> Even now, he is hidden in a cave or some other place. If he should attack your troops first, whoever hears about it will say, 'There has been a slaughter among the troops who follow Absalom.'
>
> 他现今或藏在坑中或在别处，若有人首先被杀，凡听见的必说：‘跟随押沙龙的民被杀了。’


撒下17:10
> Then even the bravest soldier, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will melt with fear, for all Israel knows that your father is a fighter and that those with him are brave.
>
> 虽有人胆大如狮子，他的心也必消化。因为以色列人都知道你父亲是英雄，跟随他的人也都是勇士。

撒下17:12
> Then we will attack him wherever he may be found, and we will fall on him as dew settles on the ground. Neither he nor any of his men will be left alive.
>
> 这样，我们在何处遇见他，就下到他那里，如同露水下在地上一般，连他带跟随他的人，一个也不留下。


撒下17:13
> If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it down to the valley until not even a piece of it can be found."
>
> 他若进了哪一座城，以色列众人必带绳子去，将那城拉到河里，甚至连一块小石头都不剩下。”


撒下17:14
> Absalom and all the men of Israel said, "The advice of Hushai the Arkite is better than that of Ahithophel." For the LORD had determined to frustrate the good advice of Ahithophel in order to bring disaster on Absalom.
>
> 押沙龙和以色列众人说：“亚基人户筛的计谋，比亚希多弗的计谋更好！”这是因耶和华定意破坏亚希多弗的良谋，为要降祸与押沙龙。


撒下17:15
> Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, "Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the elders of Israel to do such and such, but I have advised them to do so and so.

> 那家的妇人用盖盖上井口，又在上头铺上碎麦，事就没有泄漏。


撒下17:20
> When Absalom's men came to the woman at the house, they asked, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" The woman answered them, "They crossed over the brook." The men searched but found no one, so they returned to Jerusalem.
>
> 押沙龙的仆人来到那家，问妇人说：“亚希玛斯和约拿单在哪里？”妇人说：“他们过了河了。”仆人找他们，找不着，就回耶路撒冷去了。


撒下17:21
