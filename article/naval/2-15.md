# Choosing to Build Yourself

选择打造自己

The greatest superpower is the ability to change yourself.

最伟大的超能力是改变自己的能力。

What’s the biggest mistake you’ve made in your life and how did you recover?
你一生中犯过的最大的错误是什么？你是如何恢复过来的？
I’ve made a class of mistakes I would summarize the same way. The mistakes were obvious only in hindsight through one exercise, which is asking yourself: when you’re thirty, what advice would you give your twenty -year -old self? And when you’re forty, what advice would you give your thirty -year -old self? (Maybe if you’re younger, you can do it by every five years.) Sit down and say, “Okay, 2007, what was I doing? How was I feeling? 2008, what was I doing? How was I feeling? 2009, what was I doing? How was I feeling?”

我犯了一类错误，我会用同样的方式来总结。这些错误只有在事后通过一个练习才明显，那就是问问你自己：当你30岁的时候，你会给20岁的自己什么建议？当你四十岁的时候，你会给三十岁的自己什么建议呢？(也许如果你年轻一点，你可以每五年做一次。)坐下来说，“好吧，2007年，我在做什么？我当时感觉如何？2008年，我在做什么？我当时感觉如何？2009年，我在做什么？我当时感觉如何？“
Life is going to play out the way it’s going to play out. There will be some good and some bad. Most of it is actually just up to your interpretation. You’re born, you have a set of sensory experiences, and then you die. How you choose to interpret those experiences is up to you, and different people interpret them in different ways.

生活将会按照它将要进行的方式进行。会有一些好的，也有一些不好的。实际上，大部分都取决于你的解释。你出生了，你有一系列的感官体验，然后你就死了。你如何选择解释这些经历取决于你，不同的人会用不同的方式来解释它们。

Really, I wish I had done all of the same things, but with less emotion and less anger. The most celebrated example would be when I was younger, I started a company. This company did well, but I didn’t do well, so I sued some of the people involved. It was a good outcome for me in the end, and everything worked out okay, but there was a lot of angst and a lot of anger.

真的，我希望我做了所有同样的事情，但是少一些情绪，少一些愤怒。最著名的例子是在我年轻的时候，我开了一家公司。这家公司做得很好，但我做得不好，所以我起诉了一些涉案人员。最终这对我来说是个好结果，一切都很顺利，但也有很多焦虑和愤怒。

Today, I wouldn’t have the angst and the anger. I would have just walked up to the people and said, “Look, this is what happened. This is what I’m going to do. This is how I’m going to do it. This is what’s fair. This is what’s not.”

今天，我就不会有焦虑和愤怒了。我会走到人们面前说，“看，这就是发生的事情。这就是我要做的。这就是我要怎么做的。这才是公平的。这不是事实。“
I would have realized the anger and emotions are a huge, completely unnecessary consequence. Now, I’m trying to learn from that and do the same things I think are the right things to do but without anger and with a very long -term point of view. If you take a very long -term point of view and take the emotion out of it, I wouldn’t consider those things mistakes anymore. [4]

我会意识到愤怒和情绪是一个巨大的，完全不必要的后果。现在，我正试图从中吸取教训，做我认为正确的事情，但不要生气，要有非常长远的观点。如果你从一个非常长远的角度来看，把情感从其中剔除，我就不会再认为这些事情是错误的。

Again, habits are everything—everything we are. We are trained in habits from when we are children, including potty training, when to cry and when not to, how to smile and when not to. These things become habits—behaviors we learn and integrate into ourselves.

再说一次，习惯决定一切--我们的一切。我们从小就被训练成习惯，包括如厕训练，什么时候哭什么时候不哭，什么时候笑什么不笑。这些东西变成了习惯--我们学习并融入到我们自己中的行为。

When we’re older, we’re a collection of thousands of habits constantly running subconsciously. We have a little bit of extra brainpower in our neocortex for solving new problems. You become your habits.

当我们变老的时候，我们是成千上万个习惯的集合，潜意识里一直在运行。我们的大脑皮层有一点额外的脑力来解决新问题。你就成了你的习惯。

This came to light for me when my trainer gave me a routine to do every single day. I had never worked out every single day before. It’s a light workout. It’s not tough on your body, but I did this workout every single day. I realized the incredible, astonishing transformation it had on me both physically and mentally.

当我的教练给了我一个每天要做的例行公事时，我发现了这一点。我以前从来没有每天锻炼过。这是一次轻微的锻炼。这对你的身体来说并不难，但我每天都这样锻炼。我意识到它对我的身体和精神都带来了令人难以置信的、令人震惊的变化。

To have peace of mind, you have to have peace of body first.

要有心灵的安宁，首先要有身体的安宁。

This taught me the power of habits. I started realizing it’s all about habits. At any given time, I’m either trying to pick up a good habit or discard a previous bad habit. It takes time.

这教会了我习惯的力量。我开始意识到一切都与习惯有关。在任何时候，我要么试着养成一个好习惯，要么改掉以前的坏习惯。这需要时间。

If someone says, “I want to be fit, I want to be healthy. Right now, I’m out of shape and I’m fat.” Well, nothing sustainable is going to work for you in three months. It’s going to be at least a ten -year journey. Every six months (depending on how fast you can do it), you’re going to break bad habits and pick up good habits. [6]

如果有人说，“我想要健康，我想要健康。现在，我身材走样，而且很胖。“嗯，三个月内没有什么可持续的东西会对你起作用。这将是一个至少十年的旅程。每六个月(取决于你能做到多快)，你会改掉坏习惯，养成好习惯。

One of the things Krishnamurti talks about is being in an internal state of revolution. You should always be internally ready for a complete change. Whenever we say we’re going to try to do something or try to form a habit, we’re wimping out.

克里希那穆提谈到的其中一件事是处于革命的内部状态。您应该始终在内部为彻底的改变做好准备。每当我们说要试着做某事或试着养成习惯时，我们就是在畏首畏尾。

We’re just saying to ourselves, “I’m going to buy myself some more time.” The reality is when our emotions want us to do something, we just do it. If you want to go approach a pretty girl, if you want to have a drink, if you really desire something, you just go do it.

我们只是在对自己说，“我要为自己争取更多的时间。”现实是，当我们的情感要求我们去做某件事时，我们就去做。如果你想接近一个漂亮的女孩，如果你想喝一杯，如果你真的想要什么，那就去做吧。

When you say, “I’m going to do this,” and “I’m going to be that,” you’re really putting it off. You’re giving yourself an out. At least if you’re self -aware , you can think, “‘I say I want to do this, but I don’t really because if I really wanted to do it, I would just do it.”

当你说“我要做这件事”和“我要做那件事”的时候，你真的是在拖延。你这是在给自己一条出路。至少如果你有自知之明，你可以想，“我说我想做这件事，但我并不是真的想做，因为如果我真的想做，我就会去做。”

Commit externally to enough people. For example, if you want to quit smoking, all you have to do is go to everybody you know and say, “I quit smoking. I did it. I give you my word.”

对外承诺给足够多的人。例如，如果你想戒烟，你所要做的就是去找所有你认识的人说，“我戒烟了。我做到了。我向你保证。“
That’s all you need to do. Go ahead, right? But most of us say we’re not quite ready. We know we don’t want to commit ourselves externally. It’s important to be honest with yourself and say, “Okay, I’m not ready to give up smoking. I like it too much, it is going to be too hard for me to give up.”

这就是你需要做的全部事情。去吧，好吗？但是我们大多数人都说我们还没有完全准备好。我们知道我们不想对外承诺。对自己诚实并说，“好吧，我还没准备好戒烟，这一点很重要。我太喜欢了，要放弃对我来说太难了。“
Say instead, “I’ll set a more reasonable goal for myself; I’ll cut down to the following amount. I can commit to that externally. I’m going to work on that for three or six months. When I get there, I’ll take the next step, as opposed to beating myself up over it.”

相反，你可以说，“我会为自己设定一个更合理的目标，我会减少到以下数额。我可以对外承诺这一点。我要在这上面工作三到六个月。等我到了那里，我会采取下一步行动，而不是为此而自责。“
When you really want to change, you just change. But most of us don’t really want to change—we don’t want to go through the pain just yet. At least recognize it, be aware of it, and give yourself a smaller change you can actually carry out. [6]

当你真的想改变的时候，你只要改变就行了。但是我们大多数人并不真的想改变--我们现在还不想经历痛苦。至少要认识到这一点，意识到这一点，给自己一个你可以实际实施的小改变。

Impatience with actions, patience with results.

对行动不耐烦，对结果耐心。

Anything you have to do, just get it done. Why wait? You’re not getting any younger. Your life is slipping away. You don’t want to spend it waiting in line. You don’t want to spend it traveling back and forth. You don’t want to spend it doing things you know ultimately aren’t part of your mission.

不管你要做什么，只要把它做完就行了。为什么要等？你不会再年轻了。你的生命正在悄悄溜走。你不会想把这段时间花在排队上的。你不会想把时间花在来回旅行上的。你不会想把时间花在做一些你知道最终不属于你使命的事情上。

When you do them, you want to do them as quickly as you can while doing them well with your full attention. But then, you just have to be patient with the results because you’re dealing with complex systems and many people.

当你做它们的时候，你想要以最快的速度做它们，同时全神贯注地做好它们。但是，你只需要对结果保持耐心，因为你要处理的是复杂的系统和很多人。

It takes a long time for markets to adopt products. It takes time for people to get comfortable working with each other. It takes time for great products to emerge as you polish away, polish away, polish away. Impatience with actions, patience with results. As Nivi said, inspiration is perishable. When you have inspiration, act on it right then and there. [78]

市场需要很长时间才能采用产品。人们需要时间来适应彼此的工作。伟大的产品需要时间才能出现，就像你不断地磨练、磨练、磨练一样。对行动不耐烦，对结果耐心。正如尼维所说，灵感是易逝去的。当你有灵感的时候，马上行动起来。
