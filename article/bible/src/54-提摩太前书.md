# 提摩太前书
## 提摩太前书第1章
提前1:1
> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,
>
> 奉我们救主　神和我们的盼望基督耶稣之命，作基督耶稣使徒的保罗，


提前1:2
> To Timothy my true son in the faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
>
> 写信给那因信主作我真儿子的提摩太：愿恩惠、怜悯、平安从父　神和我们主基督耶稣归与你！


提前1:3
> As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain men not to teach false doctrines any longer
>
> 我往马其顿去的时候，曾劝你仍住在以弗所，好嘱咐那几个人不可传异教，


提前1:4
> nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. These promote controversies rather than God's work--which is by faith.
>
> 也不可听从荒渺无凭的话语和无穷的家谱。这等事只生辩论，并不发明　神在信上所立的章程。


提前1:5
> The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.
>
> 但命令的总归就是爱，这爱是从清洁的心和无亏的良心、无伪的信心生出来的。

> We know that the law is good if one uses it properly.
>
> 我们知道律法原是好的，只要人用得合宜。


提前1:9
> We also know that law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious; for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers,
>
> 因为律法不是为义人设立的，乃是为不法和不服的，不虔诚和犯罪的，不圣洁和恋世俗的，弑父母和杀人的，


提前1:10
> for adulterers and perverts, for slave traders and liars and perjurers--and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine
>
> 行淫和亲男色的，抢人口和说谎话的，并起假誓的，或是为别样敌正道的事设立的。

>
> 我感谢那给我力量的我们主基督耶稣，因他以我有忠心，派我服事他。


提前1:13
> Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief.
>

提前1:15
> Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners--of whom I am the worst.
>
> “基督耶稣降世，为要拯救罪人。”这话是可信的，是十分可佩服的。在罪人中我是个罪魁。


提前1:16
> But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life.
>
> 然而我蒙了怜悯，是因耶稣基督要在我这罪魁身上显明他一切的忍耐，给后来信他得永生的人作榜样。


提前1:17
> Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
>
> 但愿尊贵、荣耀归与那不能朽坏、不能看见、永世的君王、独一的　神，直到永永远远。阿们！


提前1:18
> Timothy, my son, I give you this instruction in keeping with the prophecies once made about you, so that by following them you may fight the good fight,
>
> 我儿提摩太啊，我照从前指着你的预言，将这命令交托你，叫你因此可以打那美好的仗，

提前2:9
> I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,
>
> 又愿女人廉耻、自守，以正派衣裳为妆饰，不以编发、黄金、珍珠和贵价的衣裳为妆饰；

>
> 然而，女人若常存信心、爱心，又圣洁自守，就必在生产上得救。

>

>
> 倘若我耽延日久，你也可以知道在　神的家中当怎样行；这家就是永生　神的教会，真理的柱石和根基。

>
> 他是自高自大，一无所知，专好问难争辩言词，从此就生出嫉妒，分争，毁谤，妄疑，


提前6:5
> and constant friction between men of corrupt mind, who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain.
