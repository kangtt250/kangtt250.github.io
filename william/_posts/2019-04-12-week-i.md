We dedicated the first week of the project towards documentation and design.
My task this week was to design the main character for the game.
We knew we wanted a lynx as our main character and that we wanted an aesthetic similar to games such as classic Sonic the Hedgehog and Freedom Planet.
To this end we decided to use pixel art for the game. 
I had never worked with pixel art before so this presented a fun challenge in learning a new style.
I went about finding sources and tutorials on how to do pixel art and practiced by redrawing Sonic from the game Sonic Mania.

## Character Design
When designing the character, we knew we wanted a lynx character in the vain of older Sonic games.
The Product Owner specified a few key details that they would like incorporated into the design such as the characteristically large ears of a lynx, and clothing similar to a runners outfit.
While the design is far from complete, I was able to create a simple version of the sprite complete with the large ears and an outfit I styled after popular sports brands.
