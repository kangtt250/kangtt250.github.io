I"œ<p>This week I was still sick so I wasnâ€™t able to contribute much to the project.
My task for this week was to work on designing the enemies fot the first level.</p>

<h1 id="enemy-design">Enemy Design</h1>
<p>We brainstormed as a team to come up with an idea for how the first enemy should look.
We all agreed that the first level would have a forest/nature theme and that the enemies should contrast this by being machinery.
There were a number of suggestions for what kind of weaponry they should be equipped with, such as drills, cannons, flamethrowers, etc.
In the end we decided on something similar to a buzzsaw to stay within the theme of anti-forestry.</p>
