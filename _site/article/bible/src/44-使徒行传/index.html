He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God.<p>他受害之后，用许多的凭据将自己活活地显给使徒看，四十天之久向他们显现，讲说　神国的事。</blockquote><p>徒1:4<blockquote><p>On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about.<p>耶稣和他们聚集的时候，嘱咐他们说：“不要离开耶路撒冷，要等候父所应许的，就是你们听见我说过的。</blockquote><p>徒1:5<blockquote><p>For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”<p>约翰是用水施洗，但不多几日，你们要受圣灵的洗。”</blockquote><p>徒1:6<blockquote><p>So when they met together, they asked him, “Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?”<p>他们聚集的时候，问耶稣说：“主啊，你复兴以色列国就在这时候吗？”</blockquote><p>徒1:7<blockquote><p>He said to them: “It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.<p>耶稣对他们说：“父凭着自己的权柄所定的时候、日期，不是你们可以知道的。</blockquote><p>徒1:8<blockquote><p>But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”<p>但圣灵降临在你们身上，你们就必得着能力；并要在耶路撒冷、犹太全地和撒马利亚，直到地极，作我的见证。”</blockquote><p>徒1:9<blockquote><p>After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight.<p>说了这话，他们正看的时候，他就被取上升，有一朵云彩把他接去，便看不见他了。</blockquote><p>徒1:10<blockquote><p>They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them.<p>当他往上去，他们定睛望天的时候，忽然有两个人身穿白衣，站在旁边，说：</blockquote><p>徒1:11<blockquote><p>“Men of Galilee,” they said, “why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.”<p>“加利利人哪，你们为什么站着望天呢？这离开你们被接升天的耶稣，你们见他怎样往天上去，他还要怎样来。”</blockquote><p>徒1:12<blockquote><p>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives, a Sabbath day’s walk from the city.<p>有一座山，名叫橄榄山，离耶路撒冷不远，约有安息日可走的路程。当下，门徒从那里回耶路撒冷去，</blockquote><p>徒1:13<blockquote><p>When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying.

Show us which of these two you have chosen<p>众人就祷告说，主啊，你知道万人的心，求你从这两个人中，指明你所拣选的是谁，叫他得这使徒的位分。</blockquote><p>徒1:25<blockquote><p>to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs.”<p>这位分犹大已经丢弃，往自己的地方去了。”</blockquote><p>徒1:26<blockquote><p>Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.<p>于是众人为他们摇签，摇出马提亚来；他就和十一个使徒同列。</blockquote><h2 id="使徒行传第2章">使徒行传第2章</h2><p>徒2:1<blockquote><p>When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.<p>五旬节到了，门徒都聚集在一处。</blockquote><p>徒2:2<blockquote><p>Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.<p>忽然，从天上有响声下来，好像一阵大风吹过，充满了他们所坐的屋子；</blockquote><p>徒2:3<blockquote><p>They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.<p>又有舌头如火焰显现出来，分开落在他们各人头上。</blockquote><p>徒2:4<blockquote><p>All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.<p>他们就都被圣灵充满，按着圣灵所赐的口才，说起别国的话来。</blockquote><p>徒2:5<blockquote><p>Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven.<p>那时，有虔诚的犹太人从天下各国来，住在耶路撒冷。</blockquote><p>徒2:6<blockquote><p>When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.<p>这声音一响，众人都来聚集。各人听见门徒用众人的乡谈说话，就甚纳闷，</blockquote><p>徒2:7<blockquote><p>Utterly amazed, they asked: “Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans?<p>都惊讶希奇说：“看哪，这说话的不都是加利利人吗？</blockquote><p>徒2:8<blockquote><p>Then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language?<p>我们各人怎么听见他们说我们生来所用的乡谈呢？</blockquote><p>徒2:9<blockquote><p>Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,<p>我们帕提亚人、玛代人、以拦人，和住在米所波大米、犹太、加帕多家、本都、亚西亚、</blockquote><p>徒2:10<blockquote><p>Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome<p>弗吕家、旁非利亚、埃及的人，并靠近古利奈的利比亚一带地方的人，从罗马来的客旅中，或是犹太人，或是进犹太教的人，</blockquote><p>徒2:11<blockquote><p>(both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs–we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!”<p>革哩底和亚拉伯人，都听见他们用我们的乡谈，讲说　神的大作为。”</blockquote><p>徒2:12<blockquote><p>Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, “What does this mean?”<p>众人就都惊讶猜疑，彼此说：“这是什么意思呢？”</blockquote><p>徒2:13<blockquote><p>Some, however, made fun of them and said, “They have had too much wine.”<p>还有人讥诮说：“他们无非是新酒灌满了。”</blockquote><p>徒2:14<blockquote><p>Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: “Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say.<p>彼得和十一个使徒站起，高声说：“犹太人和一切住在耶路撒冷的人哪，这件事你们当知道，也当侧耳听我的话。</blockquote><p>徒2:15<blockquote><p>These men are not drunk, as you suppose. It’s only nine in the morning!<p>你们想这些人是醉了？其实不是醉了，因为时候刚到巳初。</blockquote><p>徒2:16<blockquote><p>No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:<p>这正是先知约珥所说的：</blockquote><p>徒2:17<blockquote><p>“‘In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people.

As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.”<p>当夜，主站在保罗旁边说：“放心吧！你怎样在耶路撒冷为我作见证，也必怎样在罗马为我作见证。”</blockquote><p>徒23:12<blockquote><p>The next morning the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.<p>到了天亮，犹太人同谋起誓说：“若不先杀保罗，就不吃不喝！”</blockquote><p>徒23:13<blockquote><p>More than forty men were involved in this plot.<p>这样同心起誓的有四十多人。</blockquote><p>徒23:14<blockquote><p>They went to the chief priests and elders and said, “We have taken a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul.<p>他们来见祭司长和长老，说：“我们已经起了一个大誓，若不先杀保罗，就不吃什么。</blockquote><p>徒23:15<blockquote><p>Now then, you and the Sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him before you on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about his case. We are ready to kill him before he gets here.”<p>现在你们和公会要知会千夫长，叫他带下保罗到你们这里来，假作要详细察考他的事；我们已经预备好了，不等他来到跟前就杀他。”</blockquote><p>徒23:16<blockquote><p>But when the son of Paul’s sister heard of this plot, he went into the barracks and told Paul.<p>保罗的外甥听见他们设下埋伏，就来到营楼里告诉保罗。</blockquote><p>徒23:17<blockquote><p>Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the commander; he has something to tell him.”<p>保罗请一个百夫长来，说：“你领这少年人去见千夫长，他有事告诉他。”</blockquote><p>徒23:18<blockquote><p>So he took him to the commander. The centurion said, “Paul, the prisoner, sent for me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.”<p>于是把他领去见千夫长，说：“被囚的保罗请我到他那里，求我领这少年人来见你，他有事告诉你。”</blockquote><p>徒23:19<blockquote><p>The commander took the young man by the hand, drew him aside and asked, “What is it you want to tell me?”<p>千夫长就拉着他的手，走到一旁，私下问他说：“你有什么事告诉我呢？”</blockquote><p>徒23:20<blockquote><p>He said: “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul before the Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about him.<p>他说：“犹太人已经约定，要求你明天带下保罗到公会里去，假作要详细查问他的事。</blockquote><p>徒23:21<blockquote><p>Don’t give in to them, because more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now, waiting for your consent to their request.”<p>你切不要随从他们，因为他们有四十多人埋伏，已经起誓说，若不先杀保罗，就不吃不喝。现在预备好了，只等你应允。”</blockquote><p>徒23:22<blockquote><p>The commander dismissed the young man and cautioned him, “Don’t tell anyone that you have reported this to me.”<p>于是千夫长打发少年人走，嘱咐他说：“不要告诉人你将这事报给我了。”</blockquote><p>徒23:23<blockquote><p>Then he called two of his centurions and ordered them, “Get ready a detachment of two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at nine tonight.<p>千夫长便叫了两个百夫长来，说：“预备步兵二百，马兵七十，长枪手二百，今夜亥初往凯撒利亚去；</blockquote><p>徒23:24<blockquote><p>Provide mounts for Paul so that he may be taken safely to Governor Felix.”<p>也要预备牲口叫保罗骑上，护送到巡抚腓力斯那里去。”</blockquote><p>徒23:25<blockquote><p>He wrote a letter as follows:<p>千夫长又写了文书，</blockquote><p>徒23:26<blockquote><p>Claudius Lysias, To His Excellency, Governor Felix: Greetings.<p>大略说：革老丢吕西亚请巡抚腓力斯大人安。</blockquote><p>徒23:27<blockquote><p>This man was seized by the Jews and they were about to kill him, but I came with my troops and rescued him, for I had learned that he is a Roman citizen.<p>这人被犹太人拿住，将要杀害，我得知他是罗马人，就带兵丁下去救他出来。</blockquote><p>徒23:28<blockquote><p>I wanted to know why they were accusing him, so I brought him to their Sanhedrin.<p>因要知道他们告他的缘故，我就带他下到他们的公会去，</blockquote><p>徒23:29<blockquote><p>I found that the accusation had to do with questions about their law, but there was no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment.<p>便查知他被告是因他们律法的辩论，并没有什么该死该绑的罪名。</blockquote><p>徒23:30<blockquote><p>When I was informed of a plot to be carried out against the man, I sent him to you at once. I also ordered his accusers to present to you their case against him.<p>后来有人把要害他的计谋告诉我，我就立时解他到你那里去，又吩咐告他的人在你面前告他。（有古卷在此有“愿你平安！”）</blockquote><p>徒23:31<blockquote><p>So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul with them during the night and brought him as far as Antipatris.<p>于是兵丁照所吩咐他们的，将保罗夜里带到安提帕底。</blockquote><p>徒23:32<blockquote><p>The next day they let the cavalry go on with him, while they returned to the barracks.<p>第二天让马兵护送，他们就回营楼去。</blockquote><p>徒23:33<blockquote><p>When the cavalry arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him.<p>马兵来到凯撒利亚，把文书呈给巡抚，便叫保罗站在他面前。</blockquote><p>徒23:34<blockquote><p>The governor read the letter and asked what province he was from.
