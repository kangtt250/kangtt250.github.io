哈1:2
> How long, O LORD, must I call for help, but you do not listen? Or cry out to you, "Violence!" but you do not save?
>
> 他说：“耶和华啊，我呼求你，你不应允，要到几时呢？我因强暴哀求你，你还不拯救。


哈1:3
> Why do you make me look at injustice? Why do you tolerate wrong? Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and conflict abounds.
>
> 你为何使我看见罪孽？你为何看着奸恶而不理呢？毁灭和强暴在我面前，又起了争端和相斗的事。


哈1:4
> Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never prevails. The wicked hem in the righteous, so that justice is perverted.
>
> 因此律法放松，公理也不显明；恶人围困义人，所以公理显然颠倒。”


哈1:5
> "Look at the nations and watch--and be utterly amazed. For I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told.
>
> 耶和华说：“你们要向列国中观看，大大惊奇；因为在你们的时候，我行一件事，虽有人告诉你们，你们总是不信。


哈1:6
> I am raising up the Babylonians, that ruthless and impetuous people, who sweep across the whole earth to seize dwelling places not their own.
>

>
> 他威武可畏，判断和势力都任意发出。


哈1:8
> Their horses are swifter than leopards, fiercer than wolves at dusk. Their cavalry gallops headlong; their horsemen come from afar. They fly like a vulture swooping to devour;
>
> 他的马比豹更快，比晚上的豺狼更猛。马兵踊跃争先，都从远方而来；他们飞跑如鹰抓食，

>
> 都为行强暴而来，定住脸面向前，将掳掠的人聚集，多如尘沙。


哈1:10
> They deride kings and scoff at rulers. They laugh at all fortified cities; they build earthen ramps and capture them.
>
> 他们讥诮君王，笑话首领，嗤笑一切保障，筑垒攻取。


哈1:11
> Then they sweep past like the wind and go on--guilty men, whose own strength is their god."
>
> 他以自己的势力为　神，像风猛然扫过，显为有罪。”


哈1:12
> O LORD, are you not from everlasting? My God, my Holy One, we will not die. O LORD, you have appointed them to execute judgment; O Rock, you have ordained them to punish.
>
> 耶和华我的　神、我的圣者啊！你不是从亘古而有吗？我们必不致死。耶和华啊！你派定他为要刑罚人；磐石啊！你设立他为要惩治人。


哈1:13
> Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; you cannot tolerate wrong. Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?
>
> 你眼目清洁不看邪僻，不看奸恶；行诡诈的，你为何看着不理呢？恶人吞灭比自己公义的，你为何静默不语呢？


哈1:14
> You have made men like fish in the sea, like sea creatures that have no ruler.
>
> 你为何使人如海中的鱼，又如没有管辖的爬物呢？


哈1:15
> The wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks, he catches them in his net, he gathers them up in his dragnet; and so he rejoices and is glad.
>
> 他用钩钩住，用网捕获，用拉网聚集他们；因此，他欢喜快乐，


哈1:16
> Therefore he sacrifices to his net and burns incense to his dragnet, for by his net he lives in luxury and enjoys the choicest food.
>
> 就向网献祭，向网烧香，因他由此得肥美的分和富裕的食物。


哈1:17
> Is he to keep on emptying his net, destroying nations without mercy?
>
> 他岂可屡次倒空网罗，将列国的人时常杀戮，毫不顾惜呢？

>
> 迦勒底人自高自大，心不正直；惟义人因信得生。

>
> 迦勒底人因酒诡诈、狂傲，不住在家中，扩充心欲好像阴间。他如死不能知足，聚集万国，堆积万民都归自己。

>
> 这些国的民岂不都要题起诗歌，并俗语讥刺他说：‘祸哉！迦勒底人，你增添不属自己的财物，多多取人的当头，要到几时为止呢？’


哈2:7
> Will not your debtors suddenly arise? Will they not wake up and make you tremble? Then you will become their victim.
>
> 咬伤你的岂不忽然起来，扰害你的岂不兴起，你就作他们的掳物吗？


哈2:8
