# Curiosity has its own reason for existence.


<p> If you want to be rewarded, you have to be irreplaceable.</p>

<p> If you want to be irreplaceable, you have to be unique.</p>

<p> If you want to be unique, you have to be authentic.</p>

<p>If you want to be authentic, stop listening to everyone and everything else. </p>

<p><br>It’s drowning “you” out.</br><p>

<p><strong>Money is the bait, philosophy is the trap.</strong></p>
