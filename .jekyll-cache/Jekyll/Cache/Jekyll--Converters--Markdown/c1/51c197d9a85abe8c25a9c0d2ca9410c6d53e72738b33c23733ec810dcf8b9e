I"O<p>This week we’ve returned to our work on Project V. More below.</p>

<h1 id="our-focus">Our Focus</h1>

<p>With three weeks remaining until our deadline, we’ve decided that we should focus on creating one level for <em>Katt 
Viteză</em>. One that will showcase what we wanted to get across through gameplay and certain game mechanics. It’ll 
be a tight time limit, but we should have something we can present in early September. For this reason, the 
version of the game we’ll be presenting will be titled <em>Katt Viteză and the Metallic Menace: Demo Version</em>.
Take a look at our prototype cover art below.</p>

<p>In preparation for upload at the end of the month, I have prepared the <a href="https://itch.io/">Itch.io</a> page for our
game. At the moment, it is still being edited and it not yet visible to the public since there is no executable 
attached to the page yet. I’m happy with it so far and I will no doubt make small edits in the run-up to upload.
It’s just good to have it at the ready for when the time comes. For now, our game’s Itch.io page can be seen in
the screenshot below.</p>

Our Itch.io page in its current form. Quite a useful site for indie game developers!</p>

<p>That’s all for this week, it was mostly us getting back into the swing of things. Next week I hope to make some 
major improvements on Katt’s movement script. Wish us lots of luck in the weeks ahead!</p>

<p>‘Til next time!</p>
