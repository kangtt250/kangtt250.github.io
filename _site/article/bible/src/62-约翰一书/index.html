we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us.<p>（这生命已经显现出来，我们也看见过，现在又作见证，将原与父同在，且显现与我们那永远的生命传给你们。）</blockquote><p>约壹1:3<blockquote><p>We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.<p>我们将所看见、所听见的传给你们，使你们与我们相交。我们乃是与父并他儿子耶稣基督相交的。</blockquote><p>约壹1:4<blockquote><p>We write this to make our joy complete.<p>我们将这些话写给你们，使你们（有古卷作“我们”）的喜乐充足。</blockquote><p>约壹1:5<blockquote><p>This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light; in him there is no darkness at all.<p>神就是光，在他毫无黑暗！这是我们从主所听见、又报给你们的信息。</blockquote><p>约壹1:6<blockquote><p>If we claim to have fellowship with him yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live by the truth.<p>我们若说是与　神相交，却仍在黑暗里行，就是说谎话，不行真理了。</blockquote><p>约壹1:7<blockquote><p>But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.<p>我们若在光明中行，如同　神在光明中，就彼此相交，他儿子耶稣的血也洗净我们一切的罪。</blockquote><p>约壹1:8<blockquote><p>If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.<p>我们若说自己无罪，便是自欺，真理不在我们心里了；</blockquote><p>约壹1:9<blockquote><p>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.<p>我们若认自己的罪，　神是信实的，是公义的，必要赦免我们的罪，洗净我们一切的不义；</blockquote><p>约壹1:10<blockquote><p>If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word has no place in our lives.<p>我们若说自己没有犯过罪，便是以　神为说谎的，他的道也不在我们心里了。</blockquote><h2 id="约翰一书第2章">约翰一书第2章</h2><p>约壹2:1<blockquote><p>My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin.

If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.<p>不要爱世界和世界上的事。人若爱世界，爱父的心就不在他里面了。</blockquote><p>约壹2:16<blockquote><p>For everything in the world–the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does–comes not from the Father but from the world.<p>因为凡世界上的事，就像肉体的情欲，眼目的情欲，并今生的骄傲，都不是从父来的，乃是从世界来的。</blockquote><p>约壹2:17<blockquote><p>The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever.<p>这世界和其上的情欲都要过去，惟独遵行　神旨意的，是永远常存。</blockquote><p>约壹2:18<blockquote><p>Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour.<p>小子们哪，如今是末时了。你们曾听见说，那敌基督的要来。现在已经有好些敌基督的出来了，从此我们就知道如今是末时了。</blockquote><p>约壹2:19<blockquote><p>They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us.<p>他们从我们中间出去，却不是属我们的；若是属我们的，就必仍旧与我们同在；他们出去显明都不是属我们的。</blockquote><p>约壹2:20<blockquote><p>But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth.<p>你们从那圣者受了恩膏，并且知道这一切的事（或作“都有知识”）。</blockquote><p>约壹2:21<blockquote><p>I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth.<p>我写信给你们，不是因你们不知道真理，正是因你们知道，并且知道没有虚谎是从真理出来的。</blockquote><p>约壹2:22<blockquote><p>Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist–he denies the Father and the Son.<p>谁是说谎话的呢？不是那不认耶稣为基督的吗？不认父与子的，这就是敌基督的。</blockquote><p>约壹2:23<blockquote><p>No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also.<p>凡不认子的，就没有父；认子的，连父也有了。</blockquote><p>约壹2:24<blockquote><p>See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father.<p>论到你们，务要将那从起初所听见的常存在心里。若将从起初所听见的存在心里，你们就必住在子里面，也必住在父里面。</blockquote><p>约壹2:25<blockquote><p>And this is what he promised us–even eternal life.<p>主所应许我们的就是永生。</blockquote><p>约壹2:26<blockquote><p>I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray.<p>我将这些话写给你们，是指着那引诱你们的人说的。</blockquote><p>约壹2:27<blockquote><p>As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit–just as it has taught you, remain in him.<p>你们从主所受的恩膏常存在你们心里，并不用人教训你们，自有主的恩膏在凡事上教训你们。这恩膏是真的，不是假的，你们要按这恩膏的教训住在主里面。</blockquote><p>约壹2:28<blockquote><p>And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming.<p>小子们哪，你们要住在主里面。这样，他若显现，我们就可以坦然无惧；当他来的时候，在他面前也不至于惭愧。</blockquote><p>约壹2:29<blockquote><p>If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.<p>你们若知道他是公义的，就知道凡行公义之人都是他所生的。</blockquote><h2 id="约翰一书第3章">约翰一书第3章</h2><p>约壹3:1<blockquote><p>How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him.<p>你看父赐给我们是何等的慈爱，使我们得称为　神的儿女！我们也真是他的儿女。世人所以不认识我们，是因未曾认识他。</blockquote><p>约壹3:2<blockquote><p>Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.<p>亲爱的弟兄啊，我们现在是　神的儿女，将来如何，还未显明；但我们知道，主若显现，我们必要像他，因为必得见他的真体。</blockquote><p>约壹3:3<blockquote><p>Everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as he is pure.<p>凡向他有这指望的，就洁净自己，像他洁净一样。</blockquote><p>约壹3:4<blockquote><p>Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness.<p>凡犯罪的，就是违背律法；违背律法，就是罪。</blockquote><p>约壹3:5<blockquote><p>But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin.<p>你们知道主曾显现，是要除掉人的罪，在他并没有罪。</blockquote><p>约壹3:6<blockquote><p>No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him.<p>凡住在他里面的，就不犯罪；凡犯罪的，是未曾看见他，也未曾认识他。</blockquote><p>约壹3:7<blockquote><p>Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. He who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous.<p>小子们哪，不要被人诱惑。行义的才是义人，正如主是义的一样。</blockquote><p>约壹3:8<blockquote><p>He who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil’s work.<p>犯罪的是属魔鬼，因为魔鬼从起初就犯罪。　神的儿子显现出来，为要除灭魔鬼的作为。</blockquote><p>约壹3:9<blockquote><p>No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God’s seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God.<p>凡从　神生的，就不犯罪，因　神的道（原文作“种”）存在他心里；他也不能犯罪，因为他是由　神生的。</blockquote><p>约壹3:10<blockquote><p>This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not a child of God; nor is anyone who does not love his brother.<p>从此就显出谁是　神的儿女，谁是魔鬼的儿女。凡不行义的就不属　神，不爱弟兄的也是如此。</blockquote><p>约壹3:11<blockquote><p>This is the message you heard from the beginning: We should love one another.<p>我们应当彼此相爱，这就是你们从起初所听见的命令。</blockquote><p>约壹3:12<blockquote><p>Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brother’s were righteous.<p>不可像该隐，他是属那恶者，杀了他的兄弟。为什么杀了他呢？因自己的行为是恶的，兄弟的行为是善的。</blockquote><p>约壹3:13<blockquote><p>Do not be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you.<p>弟兄们，世人若恨你们，不要以为希奇。</blockquote><p>约壹3:14<blockquote><p>We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love our brothers. Anyone who does not love remains in death.<p>我们因为爱弟兄，就晓得是已经出死入生了。没有爱心的，仍住在死中。</blockquote><p>约壹3:15<blockquote><p>Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life in him.<p>凡恨他弟兄的，就是杀人的；你们晓得凡杀人的，没有永生存在他里面。</blockquote><p>约壹3:16<blockquote><p>This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.<p>主为我们舍命，我们从此就知道何为爱，我们也当为弟兄舍命。</blockquote><p>约壹3:17<blockquote><p>If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be in him?<p>凡有世上财物的，看见弟兄穷乏，却塞住怜恤的心，爱　神的心怎能存在他里面呢？</blockquote><p>约壹3:18<blockquote><p>Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth.<p>小子们哪，我们相爱，不要只在言语和舌头上，总要在行为和诚实上。</blockquote><p>约壹3:19<blockquote><p>This then is how we know that we belong to the truth, and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence<p>从此，就知道我们是属真理的，并且我们的心在　神面前可以安稳。</blockquote><p>约壹3:20<blockquote><p>whenever our hearts condemn us. For God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything.<p>我们的心若责备我们，　神比我们的心大，一切事没有不知道的。</blockquote><p>约壹3:21<blockquote><p>Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God<p>亲爱的弟兄啊，我们的心若不责备我们，就可以向　神坦然无惧了。</blockquote><p>约壹3:22<blockquote><p>and receive from him anything we ask, because we obey his commands and do what pleases him.<p>并且我们一切所求的，就从他得着，因为我们遵守他的命令，行他所喜悦的事。</blockquote><p>约壹3:23<blockquote><p>And this is his command: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us.<p>神的命令就是叫我们信他儿子耶稣基督的名，且照他所赐给我们的命令彼此相爱。</blockquote><p>约壹3:24<blockquote><p>Those who obey his commands live in him, and he in them. And this is how we know that he lives in us: We know it by the Spirit he gave us.<p>遵守　神命令的，就住在　神里面，　神也住在他里面。我们所以知道　神住在我们里面，是因他所赐给我们的圣灵。</blockquote><h2 id="约翰一书第4章">约翰一书第4章</h2><p>约壹4:1<blockquote><p>Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.<p>亲爱的弟兄啊，一切的灵，你们不可都信，总要试验那些灵是出于　神的不是，因为世上有许多假先知已经出来了。</blockquote><p>约壹4:2<blockquote><p>This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,<p>凡灵认耶稣基督是成了肉身来的，就是出于　神的，从此你们可以认出　神的灵来。</blockquote><p>约壹4:3<blockquote><p>but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.<p>凡灵不认耶稣，就不是出于　神，这是那敌基督者的灵。你们从前听见他要来，现在已经在世上了。</blockquote><p>约壹4:4<blockquote><p>You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.<p>小子们哪，你们是属　神的，并且胜了他们，因为那在你们里面的，比那在世界上的更大。</blockquote><p>约壹4:5<blockquote><p>They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them.<p>他们是属世界的，所以论世界的事，世人也听从他们。</blockquote><p>约壹4:6<blockquote><p>We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood.<p>我们是属　神的，认识　神的就听从我们；不属　神的，就不听从我们。从此我们可以认出真理的灵和谬妄的灵来。</blockquote><p>约壹4:7<blockquote><p>Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.<p>亲爱的弟兄啊，我们应当彼此相爱，因为爱是从　神来的。凡有爱心的，都是由　神而生，并且认识　神。</blockquote><p>约壹4:8<blockquote><p>Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.<p>没有爱心的，就不认识　神，因为　神就是爱。</blockquote><p>约壹4:9<blockquote><p>This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.<p>神差他独生子到世间来，使我们藉着他得生，　神爱我们的心在此就显明了。</blockquote><p>约壹4:10<blockquote><p>This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.<p>不是我们爱　神，乃是　神爱我们，差他的儿子，为我们的罪作了挽回祭，这就是爱了。</blockquote><p>约壹4:11<blockquote><p>Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.<p>亲爱的弟兄啊，　神既是这样爱我们，我们也当彼此相爱。</blockquote><p>约壹4:12<blockquote><p>No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.<p>从来没有人见过　神，我们若彼此相爱，　神就住在我们里面，爱他的心在我们里面得以完全了。</blockquote><p>约壹4:13<blockquote><p>We know that we live in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.<p>神将他的灵赐给我们，从此就知道我们是住在他里面，他也住在我们里面。</blockquote><p>约壹4:14<blockquote><p>And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world.<p>父差子作世人的救主，这是我们所看见且作见证的。</blockquote><p>约壹4:15<blockquote><p>If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in him and he in God.<p>凡认耶稣为　神儿子的，　神就住在他里面，他也住在　神里面。</blockquote><p>约壹4:16<blockquote><p>And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in him.<p>神爱我们的心，我们也知道、也信。　神就是爱！住在爱里面的，就是住在　神里面，　神也住在他里面。</blockquote><p>约壹4:17<blockquote><p>In this way, love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like him.<p>这样，爱在我们里面得以完全，我们就可以在审判的日子坦然无惧。因为他如何，我们在这世上也如何。</blockquote><p>约壹4:18<blockquote><p>There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.<p>爱里没有惧怕；爱既完全，就把惧怕除去，因为惧怕里含着刑罚，惧怕的人在爱里未得完全。</blockquote><p>约壹4:19<blockquote><p>We love because he first loved us.<p>我们爱，因为　神先爱我们。</blockquote><p>约壹4:20<blockquote><p>If anyone says, “I love God,” yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.<p>人若说“我爱　神”，却恨他的弟兄，就是说谎话的；不爱他所看见的弟兄，就不能爱没有看见的　神（有古卷作“怎能爱没有看见的　神呢？”）。</blockquote><p>约壹4:21<blockquote><p>And he has given us this command: Whoever loves God must also love his brother.<p>爱　神的，也当爱弟兄，这是我们从　神所受的命令。</blockquote><h2 id="约翰一书第5章">约翰一书第5章</h2><p>约壹5:1<blockquote><p>Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well.<p>凡信耶稣是基督的，都是从　神而生。凡爱生他之神的，也必爱从　神生的。</blockquote><p>约壹5:2<blockquote><p>This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands.<p>我们若爱　神，又遵守他的诫命，从此就知道我们爱　神的儿女。</blockquote><p>约壹5:3<blockquote><p>This is love for God: to obey his commands. And his commands are not burdensome,<p>我们遵守　神的诫命，这就是爱他了，并且他的诫命不是难守的。</blockquote><p>约壹5:4<blockquote><p>for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith.<p>因为凡从　神生的，就胜过世界；使我们胜了世界的，就是我们的信心。</blockquote><p>约壹5:5<blockquote><p>Who is it that overcomes the world? Only he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.<p>胜过世界的是谁呢？不是那信耶稣是　神儿子的吗？</blockquote><p>约壹5:6<blockquote><p>This is the one who came by water and blood–Jesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.<p>这藉着水和血而来的，就是耶稣基督；不是单用水，乃是用水又用血，</blockquote><p>约壹5:7<blockquote><p>For there are three that testify:<p>并且有圣灵作见证，因为圣灵就是真理。</blockquote><p>约壹5:8<blockquote><p>the Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement.<p>作见证的原来有三：就是圣灵、水与血，这三样也都归于一。</blockquote><p>约壹5:9<blockquote><p>We accept man’s testimony, but God’s testimony is greater because it is the testimony of God, which he has given about his Son.<p>我们既领受人的见证，　神的见证更该领受了（“该领受”原文作“大”），因　神的见证是为他儿子作的。</blockquote><p>约壹5:10<blockquote><p>Anyone who believes in the Son of God has this testimony in his heart. Anyone who does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because he has not believed the testimony God has given about his Son.<p>信　神儿子的，就有这见证在他心里；不信　神的，就是将　神当作说谎的，因不信　神为他儿子作的见证。</blockquote><p>约壹5:11<blockquote><p>And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.<p>这见证就是　神赐给我们永生，这永生也是在他儿子里面。</blockquote><p>约壹5:12<blockquote><p>He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.<p>人有了　神的儿子就有生命；没有　神的儿子就没有生命。</blockquote><p>约壹5:13<blockquote><p>I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.<p>我将这些话写给你们信奉　神儿子之名的人，要叫你们知道自己有永生。</blockquote><p>约壹5:14<blockquote><p>This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.<p>我们若照他的旨意求什么，他就听我们，这是我们向他所存坦然无惧的心。</blockquote><p>约壹5:15<blockquote><p>And if we know that he hears us–whatever we ask–we know that we have what we asked of him.<p>既然知道他听我们一切所求的，就知道我们所求于他的，无不得着。</blockquote><p>约壹5:16<blockquote><p>If anyone sees his brother commit a sin that does not lead to death, he should pray and God will give him life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that he should pray about that.<p>人若看见弟兄犯了不至于死的罪，就当为他祈求，　神必将生命赐给他；有至于死的罪，我不说当为这罪祈求。</blockquote><p>约壹5:17<blockquote><p>All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death.<p>凡不义的事都是罪，也有不至于死的罪。</blockquote><p>约壹5:18<blockquote><p>We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the one who was born of God keeps him safe, and the evil one cannot harm him.<p>我们知道凡从　神生的，必不犯罪，从　神生的，必保守自己（有古卷作“那从　神生的必保护他”），那恶者也就无法害他。</blockquote><p>约壹5:19<blockquote><p>We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one.<p>我们知道我们是属　神的，全世界都卧在那恶者手下。</blockquote><p>约壹5:20<blockquote><p>We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true. And we are in him who is true–even in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.<p>我们也知道　神的儿子已经来到，且将智慧赐给我们，使我们认识那位真实的，我们也在那位真实的里面，就是在他儿子耶稣基督里面。这是真　神，也是永生。</blockquote><p>约壹5:21<blockquote><p>Dear children, keep yourselves from idols.<p>小子们哪，你们要自守，远避偶像！</blockquote></article><footer role="contentinfo"><hr/><p><small class="copyright">© Seon Zhu 2022.
