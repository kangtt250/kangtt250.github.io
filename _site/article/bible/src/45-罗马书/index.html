and I pray that now at last by God’s will the way may be opened for me to come to you.<p>在祷告之间常常恳求，或者照　神的旨意，终能得平坦的道路往你们那里去。</blockquote><p>罗1:11<blockquote><p>I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong–<p>因为我切切地想见你们，要把些属灵的恩赐分给你们，使你们可以坚固。</blockquote><p>罗1:12<blockquote><p>that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith.<p>这样，我在你们中间，因你与我彼此的信心，就可以同得安慰。</blockquote><p>罗1:13<blockquote><p>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.<p>弟兄们，我不愿意你们不知道，我屡次定意往你们那里去，要在你们中间得些果子，如同在其余的外邦人中一样；只是到如今仍有阻隔。</blockquote><p>罗1:14<blockquote><p>I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.<p>无论是希利尼人、化外人、聪明人、愚拙人，我都欠他们的债。</blockquote><p>罗1:15<blockquote><p>That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are at Rome.<p>所以情愿尽我的力量，将福音也传给你们在罗马的人。</blockquote><p>罗1:16<blockquote><p>I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.<p>我不以福音为耻；这福音本是　神的大能，要救一切相信的，先是犹太人，后是希利尼人。</blockquote><p>罗1:17<blockquote><p>For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.”<p>因为　神的义正在这福音上显明出来；这义是本于信，以至于信。如经上所记：“义人必因信得生。”</blockquote><p>罗1:18<blockquote><p>The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness,<p>原来，　神的忿怒，从天上显明在一切不虔不义的人身上，就是那些行不义阻挡真理的人。</blockquote><p>罗1:19<blockquote><p>since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.<p>神的事情，人所能知道的，原显明在人心里，因为　神已经给他们显明。</blockquote><p>罗1:20<blockquote><p>For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities–his eternal power and divine nature–have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.<p>自从造天地以来，　神的永能和　神性是明明可知的，虽是眼不能见，但借着所造之物就可以晓得，叫人无可推诿。</blockquote><p>罗1:21<blockquote><p>For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.<p>因为他们虽然知道　神，却不当作　神荣耀他，也不感谢他。他们的思念变为虚妄，无知的心就昏暗了。</blockquote><p>罗1:22<blockquote><p>Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools<p>自称为聪明，反成了愚拙；</blockquote><p>罗1:23<blockquote><p>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.<p>将不能朽坏之神的荣耀变为偶像，仿佛必朽坏的人和飞禽、走兽、昆虫的样式。</blockquote><p>罗1:24<blockquote><p>Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.<p>所以，　神任凭他们逞着心里的情欲行污秽的事，以致彼此玷辱自己的身体。</blockquote><p>罗1:25<blockquote><p>They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator–who is forever praised. Amen.<p>他们将　神的真实变为虚谎，去敬拜事奉受造之物，不敬奉那造物的主。主乃是可称颂的，直到永远。阿们！</blockquote><p>罗1:26<blockquote><p>Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.<p>因此，　神任凭他们放纵可羞耻的情欲。他们的女人把顺性的用处变为逆性的用处；</blockquote><p>罗1:27<blockquote><p>In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.<p>男人也是如此，弃了女人顺性的用处，欲火攻心，彼此贪恋，男和男行可羞耻的事，就在自己身上受这妄为当得的报应。</blockquote><p>罗1:28<blockquote><p>Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.<p>他们既然故意不认识　神，　神就任凭他们存邪僻的心，行那些不合理的事；</blockquote><p>罗1:29<blockquote><p>They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips,<p>装满了各样不义、邪恶、贪婪、恶毒（或作“阴毒”），满心是嫉妒、凶杀、争竞、诡诈、毒恨，</blockquote><p>罗1:30<blockquote><p>slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents;<p>又是谗毁的、背后说人的、怨恨　神的（或作“被　神所憎恶的”）、侮慢人的、狂傲的、自夸的、捏造恶事的、违背父母的、</blockquote><p>罗1:31<blockquote><p>they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.<p>无知的、背约的、无亲情的、不怜悯人的。</blockquote><p>罗1:32<blockquote><p>Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.<p>他们虽知道　神判定行这样事的人是当死的，然而他们不但自己去行，还喜欢别人去行。</blockquote><h2 id="罗马书第2章">罗马书第2章</h2><p>罗2:1<blockquote><p>You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.<p>你这论断人的，无论你是谁，也无可推诿。你在什么事上论断人，就在什么事上定自己的罪，因你这论断人的，自己所行却和别人一样。</blockquote><p>罗2:2<blockquote><p>Now we know that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth.<p>我们知道这样行的人，　神必照真理审判他。</blockquote><p>罗2:3<blockquote><p>So when you, a mere man, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God’s judgment?<p>你这人哪，你论断行这样事的人，自己所行的却和别人一样！你以为能逃脱　神的审判吗？</blockquote><p>罗2:4<blockquote><p>Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, tolerance and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness leads you toward repentance?<p>还是你藐视他丰富的恩慈、宽容、忍耐，不晓得他的恩慈是领你悔改呢？</blockquote><p>罗2:5<blockquote><p>But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God’s wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed.<p>你竟任着你刚硬不悔改的心，为自己积蓄忿怒，以致　神震怒，显他公义审判的日子来到。</blockquote><p>罗2:6<blockquote><p>God “will give to each person according to what he has done.”<p>他必照各人的行为报应各人。</blockquote><p>罗2:7<blockquote><p>To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.<p>凡恒心行善，寻求荣耀、尊贵和不能朽坏之福的，就以永生报应他们；</blockquote><p>罗2:8<blockquote><p>But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger.<p>惟有结党不顺从真理，反顺从不义的，就以忿怒、恼恨报应他们。</blockquote><p>罗2:9<blockquote><p>There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile;<p>将患难、困苦加给一切作恶的人，先是犹太人，后是希利尼人；</blockquote><p>罗2:10<blockquote><p>but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.<p>却将荣耀、尊贵、平安加给一切行善的人，先是犹太人，后是希利尼人。</blockquote><p>罗2:11<blockquote><p>For God does not show favoritism.<p>因为　神不偏待人。</blockquote><p>罗2:12<blockquote><p>All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.<p>凡没有律法犯了罪的，也必不按律法灭亡；凡在律法以下犯了罪的，也必按律法受审判。</blockquote><p>罗2:13<blockquote><p>For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God’s sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.<p>（原来，在　神面前不是听律法的为义，乃是行律法的称义。</blockquote><p>罗2:14<blockquote><p>(Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law,<p>没有律法的外邦人，若顺着本性行律法上的事，他们虽然没有律法，自己就是自己的律法。</blockquote><p>罗2:15<blockquote><p>since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.)<p>这是显出律法的功用刻在他们心里，他们是非之心同作见证，并且他们的思念互相较量，或以为是，或以为非。）</blockquote><p>罗2:16<blockquote><p>This will take place on the day when God will judge men’s secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.<p>就在　神借耶稣基督审判人隐秘事的日子，照着我的福音所言。</blockquote><p>罗2:17<blockquote><p>Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and brag about your relationship to God;<p>你称为犹太人，又倚靠律法，且指着　神夸口；</blockquote><p>罗2:18<blockquote><p>if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law;<p>既从律法中受了教训，就晓得　神的旨意，也能分别是非（或作“也喜爱那美好的事”）；</blockquote><p>罗2:19<blockquote><p>if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in the dark,<p>又深信自己是给瞎子领路的，是黑暗中人的光，</blockquote><p>罗2:20<blockquote><p>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth–<p>是蠢笨人的师傅，是小孩子的先生，在律法上有知识和真理的模范。</blockquote><p>罗2:21<blockquote><p>you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?<p>你既是教导别人，还不教导自己吗？你讲说人不可偷窃，自己还偷窃吗？</blockquote><p>罗2:22<blockquote><p>You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?<p>你说人不可奸淫，自己还奸淫吗？你厌恶偶像，自己还偷窃庙中之物吗？</blockquote><p>罗2:23<blockquote><p>You who brag about the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?<p>你指着律法夸口，自己倒犯律法玷辱　神吗？</blockquote><p>罗2:24<blockquote><p>As it is written: “God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”<p>神的名在外邦人中，因你们受了亵渎，正如经上所记的。</blockquote><p>罗2:25<blockquote><p>Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised.<p>你若是行律法的，割礼固然于你有益；若是犯律法的，你的割礼就算不得割礼。</blockquote><p>罗2:26<blockquote><p>If those who are not circumcised keep the law’s requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised?<p>所以那未受割礼的，若遵守律法的条例，他虽然未受割礼，岂不算是有割礼吗？</blockquote><p>罗2:27<blockquote><p>The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.<p>而且那本来未受割礼的，若能全守律法，岂不是要审判你这有仪文和割礼竟犯律法的人吗？</blockquote><p>罗2:28<blockquote><p>A man is not a Jew if he is only one outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical.<p>因为外面作犹太人的，不是真犹太人；外面肉身的割礼，也不是真割礼。</blockquote><p>罗2:29<blockquote><p>No, a man is a Jew if he is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a man’s praise is not from men, but from God.<p>惟有里面作的，才是真犹太人；真割礼也是心里的，在乎灵，不在乎仪文。这人的称赞不是从人来的，乃是从　神来的。</blockquote><h2 id="罗马书第3章">罗马书第3章</h2><p>罗3:1<blockquote><p>What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew, or what value is there in circumcision?<p>这样说来，犹太人有什么长处，割礼有什么益处呢？</blockquote><p>罗3:2<blockquote><p>Much in every way! First of all, they have been entrusted with the very words of God.<p>凡事大有好处，第一是　神的圣言交托他们。</blockquote><p>罗3:3<blockquote><p>What if some did not have faith? Will their lack of faith nullify God’s faithfulness?<p>即便有不信的，这有何妨呢？难道他们的不信，就废掉　神的信吗？</blockquote><p>罗3:4<blockquote><p>Not at all! Let God be true, and every man a liar. As it is written: “So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge.”<p>断乎不能！不如说，　神是真实的，人都是虚谎的。如经上所记：“你责备人的时候，显为公义；被人议论的时候，可以得胜。”</blockquote><p>罗3:5<blockquote><p>But if our unrighteousness brings out God’s righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.)<p>我且照着人的常话说，我们的不义若显出　神的义来，我们可以怎么说呢？　神降怒，是他不义吗？</blockquote><p>罗3:6<blockquote><p>Certainly not!
