## 列王纪下第1章
王下1:1
> After Ahab's death, Moab rebelled against Israel.
>
> 亚哈死后，摩押背叛以色列。


王下1:2
> Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers, saying to them, "Go and consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this injury."
>
> 亚哈谢在撒马利亚，一日，从楼上的栏杆里掉下来，就病了；于是差遣使者说：“你们去问以革伦的　神巴力西卜，我这病能好不能好？”


王下1:3
> But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, "Go up and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going off to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?'
>
> 但耶和华的使者对提斯比人以利亚说：“你起来，去迎着撒马利亚王的使者，对他们说：‘你们去问以革伦　神巴力西卜，岂因以色列中没有　神吗？’


王下1:4
> Therefore this is what the LORD says: 'You will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!'" So Elijah went.
>
> 所以耶和华如此说：‘你必不下你所上的床，必定要死！’”以利亚就去了。


王下1:5
> When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, "Why have you come back?"
>
> 使者回来见王，王问他们说：“你们为什么回来呢？”


王下1:6
> "A man came to meet us," they replied. "And he said to us, 'Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, "This is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending men to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!" '"
>
> 使者回答说：“有一个人迎着我们来，对我们说：‘你们回去见差你们来的王，对他说：耶和华如此说：你差人去问以革伦　神巴力西卜，岂因以色列中没有　神吗？所以，你必不下所上的床，必定要死！’”


王下1:7
> The king asked them, "What kind of man was it who came to meet you and told you this?"
>
> 王问他们说：“迎着你们来告诉你们这话的，是怎样的人？”


王下1:8
> They replied, "He was a man with a garment of hair and with a leather belt around his waist." The king said, "That was Elijah the Tishbite."
>
> 回答说：“他身穿毛衣，腰束皮带。”王说：“这必是提斯比人以利亚。”


王下1:9
> Then he sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men. The captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, "Man of God, the king says, 'Come down!'"
>
> 于是，王差遣五十夫长，带领五十人去见以利亚，他就上到以利亚那里；以利亚正坐在山顶上。五十夫长对他说：“神人哪，王吩咐你下来！”


王下1:10
> Elijah answered the captain, "If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!" Then fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men.
>
> 以利亚回答说：“我若是神人，愿火从天上降下来，烧灭你和你那五十人！”于是有火从天上降下来，烧灭五十夫长和他那五十人。


王下1:11
> At this the king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men. The captain said to him, "Man of God, this is what the king says, 'Come down at once!'"
>
> 王第二次差遣一个五十夫长，带领五十人去见以利亚。五十夫长对以利亚说：“神人哪，王吩咐你快快下来！”


王下1:12
> "If I am a man of God," Elijah replied, "may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!" Then the fire of God fell from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.
>
> 以利亚回答说：“我若是神人，愿火从天上降下来，烧灭你和你那五十人！”于是　神的火从天上降下来，烧灭五十夫长和他那五十人。


王下1:13
> So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. This third captain went up and fell on his knees before Elijah. "Man of God," he begged, "please have respect for my life and the lives of these fifty men, your servants!
>
> 王第三次差遣一个五十夫长，带领五十人去。这五十夫长上去，双膝跪在以利亚面前，哀求他说：“神人哪，愿我的性命和你这五十个仆人的性命在你眼前看为宝贵。


王下1:14
> See, fire has fallen from heaven and consumed the first two captains and all their men. But now have respect for my life!"
>
> 已经有火从天上降下来，烧灭前两次来的五十夫长和他们各自带的五十人；现在愿我的性命在你眼前看为宝贵。”


王下1:15
> The angel of the LORD said to Elijah, "Go down with him; do not be afraid of him." So Elijah got up and went down with him to the king.
>
> 耶和华的使者对以利亚说：“你同着他下去，不要怕他。”以利亚就起来，同着他下去见王，


王下1:16
> He told the king, "This is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel for you to consult that you have sent messengers to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Because you have done this, you will never leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!"
>
> 对王说：“耶和华如此说：你差人去问以革伦　神巴力西卜，岂因以色列中没有　神可以求问吗？所以你必不下所上的床，必定要死！”


王下1:17
> So he died, according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. Because Ahaziah had no son, Joram succeeded him as king in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah.
>
> 亚哈谢果然死了，正如耶和华藉以利亚所说的话。因他没有儿子，他兄弟约兰接续他作王，正在犹大王约沙法的儿子约兰第二年。


王下1:18
> As for all the other events of Ahaziah's reign, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
>
> 亚哈谢其余所行的事都写在以色列诸王记上。


## 列王纪下第2章
王下2:1
> When the LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal.
>
> 耶和华要用旋风接以利亚升天的时候，以利亚与以利沙从吉甲前往。


王下2:2
> Elijah said to Elisha, "Stay here; the LORD has sent me to Bethel." But Elisha said, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went down to Bethel.
>
> 以利亚对以利沙说：“耶和华差我往伯特利去，你可以在这里等候。”以利沙说：“我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我必不离开你。”于是二人下到伯特利。


王下2:3
> The company of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and asked, "Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master from you today?" "Yes, I know," Elisha replied, "but do not speak of it."
>
> 住伯特利的先知门徒出来见以利沙，对他说：“耶和华今日要接你的师傅离开你，你知道不知道？”他说：“我知道！你们不要作声。”


王下2:4
> Then Elijah said to him, "Stay here, Elisha; the LORD has sent me to Jericho." And he replied, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went to Jericho.
>
> 以利亚对以利沙说：“耶和华差遣我往耶利哥去，你可以在这里等候。”以利沙说：“我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我必不离开你。”于是二人到了耶利哥。


王下2:5
> The company of the prophets at Jericho went up to Elisha and asked him, "Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master from you today?" "Yes, I know," he replied, "but do not speak of it."
>
> 住耶利哥的先知门徒就近以利沙，对他说：“耶和华今日要接你的师傅离开你，你知道不知道？”他说：“我知道！你们不要作声。”


王下2:6
> Then Elijah said to him, "Stay here; the LORD has sent me to the Jordan." And he replied, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So the two of them walked on.
>
> 以利亚对以利沙说：“耶和华差遣我往约旦河去，你可以在这里等候。”以利沙说：“我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我必不离开你。”于是二人一同前往。


王下2:7
> Fifty men of the company of the prophets went and stood at a distance, facing the place where Elijah and Elisha had stopped at the Jordan.
>
> 有先知门徒去了五十人，远远地站在他们对面，二人在约旦河边站住。


王下2:8
> Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up and struck the water with it. The water divided to the right and to the left, and the two of them crossed over on dry ground.
>
> 以利亚将自己的外衣卷起来，用以打水，水就左右分开，二人走干地而过。


王下2:9
> When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, "Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?" "Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit," Elisha replied.
>
> 过去之后，以利亚对以利沙说：“我未曾被接去离开你，你要我为你做什么，只管求我。”以利沙说：“愿感动你的灵加倍地感动我。”


王下2:10
> "You have asked a difficult thing," Elijah said, "yet if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours--otherwise not."
>
> 以利亚说：“你所求的难得。虽然如此，我被接去离开你的时候，你若看见我，就必得着；不然，必得不着了。”


王下2:11
> As they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind.
>
> 他们正走着说话，忽有火车火马将二人隔开，以利亚就乘旋风升天去了。


王下2:12
> Elisha saw this and cried out, "My father! My father! The chariots and horsemen of Israel!" And Elisha saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them apart.
>
> 以利沙看见，就呼叫说：“我父啊！我父啊！以色列的战车马兵啊！”以后不再见他了。于是以利沙把自己的衣服撕为两片。


王下2:13
> He picked up the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.
>
> 他拾起以利亚身上掉下来的外衣，回去站在约旦河边。


王下2:14
> Then he took the cloak that had fallen from him and struck the water with it. "Where now is the LORD, the God of Elijah?" he asked. When he struck the water, it divided to the right and to the left, and he crossed over.
>
> 他用以利亚身上掉下来的外衣打水，说：“耶和华，以利亚的　神在哪里呢？”打水之后，水也左右分开，以利沙就过来了。


王下2:15
> The company of the prophets from Jericho, who were watching, said, "The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha." And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.
>
> 住耶利哥的先知门徒从对面看见他，就说：“感动以利亚的灵感动以利沙了。”他们就来迎接他，在他面前俯伏于地，


王下2:16
> "Look," they said, "we your servants have fifty able men. Let them go and look for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has picked him up and set him down on some mountain or in some valley." "No," Elisha replied, "do not send them."
>
> 对他说：“仆人们这里有五十个壮士，求你容他们去寻找你师傅，或者耶和华的灵将他提起来，投在某山某谷。”以利沙说：“你们不必打发人去。”


王下2:17
> But they persisted until he was too ashamed to refuse. So he said, "Send them." And they sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find him.
>
> 他们再三催促他，他难以推辞，就说：“你们打发人去吧！”他们便打发五十人去，寻找了三天，也没有找着。


王下2:18
> When they returned to Elisha, who was staying in Jericho, he said to them, "Didn't I tell you not to go?"
>
> 以利沙仍然在耶利哥，等候他们回到他那里；他对他们说：“我岂没有告诉你们不必去吗？”


王下2:19
> The men of the city said to Elisha, "Look, our lord, this town is well situated, as you can see, but the water is bad and the land is unproductive."
>
> 耶利哥城的人对以利沙说：“这城的地势美好，我主看见了;只是水恶劣，土产不熟而落。”


王下2:20
> "Bring me a new bowl," he said, "and put salt in it." So they brought it to him.
>
> 以利沙说：“你们拿一个新瓶来装盐给我。”他们就拿来给他。


王下2:21
> Then he went out to the spring and threw the salt into it, saying, "This is what the LORD says: 'I have healed this water. Never again will it cause death or make the land unproductive.'"
>
> 他出到水源，将盐倒在水中说：“耶和华如此说：‘我治好了这水，从此必不再使人死，也不再使地土不生产。’”


王下2:22
> And the water has remained wholesome to this day, according to the word Elisha had spoken.
>
> 于是那水治好了，直到今日，正如以利沙所说的。


王下2:23
> From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some youths came out of the town and jeered at him. "Go on up, you baldhead!" they said. "Go on up, you baldhead!"
>
> 以利沙从那里上伯特利去。正上去的时候，有些童子从城里出来，戏笑他说：“秃头的上去吧！秃头的上去吧！”


王下2:24
> He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths.
>
> 他回头看见，就奉耶和华的名咒诅他们。于是有两个母熊从林中出来，撕裂他们中间四十二个童子。


王下2:25
> And he went on to Mount Carmel and from there returned to Samaria.
>
> 以利沙从伯特利上迦密山，又从迦密山回到撒马利亚。


## 列王纪下第3章
王下3:1
> Joram son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned twelve years.
>
> 犹大王约沙法十八年，亚哈的儿子约兰在撒马利亚登基，作了以色列王十二年。


王下3:2
> He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, but not as his father and mother had done. He got rid of the sacred stone of Baal that his father had made.
>
> 他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，但不至像他父母所行的，因为除掉他父所造巴力的柱像。


王下3:3
> Nevertheless he clung to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn away from them.
>
> 然而，他贴近尼八的儿子耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪，总不离开。


王下3:4
> Now Mesha king of Moab raised sheep, and he had to supply the king of Israel with a hundred thousand lambs and with the wool of a hundred thousand rams.
>
> 摩押王米沙牧养许多羊，每年将十万羊羔的毛和十万公绵羊的毛给以色列王进贡。


王下3:5
> But after Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
>
> 亚哈死后，摩押王背叛以色列王。


王下3:6
> So at that time King Joram set out from Samaria and mobilized all Israel.
>
> 那时约兰王出撒马利亚，数点以色列众人。


王下3:7
> He also sent this message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah: "The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?" "I will go with you," he replied. "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."
>
> 前行的时候，差人去见犹大王约沙法说：“摩押王背叛我，你肯同我去攻打摩押吗？”他说：“我肯上去。你我不分彼此，我的民与你的民一样，我的马与你的马一样。”


王下3:8
> "By what route shall we attack?" he asked. "Through the Desert of Edom," he answered.
>
> 约兰说：“我们从哪条路上去呢？”回答说：“从以东旷野的路上去。”


王下3:9
> So the king of Israel set out with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. After a roundabout march of seven days, the army had no more water for themselves or for the animals with them.
>
> 于是，以色列王和犹大王，并以东王，都一同去绕行七日的路程，军队和所带的牲畜没有水喝。


王下3:10
> "What!" exclaimed the king of Israel. "Has the LORD called us three kings together only to hand us over to Moab?"
>
> 以色列王说：“哀哉！耶和华招聚我们这三王，乃要交在摩押人的手里。”


王下3:11
> But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there no prophet of the LORD here, that we may inquire of the LORD through him?" An officer of the king of Israel answered, "Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah."
>
> 约沙法说：“这里不是有耶和华的先知吗？我们可以托他求问耶和华。”以色列王的一个臣子回答说：“这里有沙法的儿子以利沙，就是从前服事以利亚的（原文作“倒水在以利亚手上的”）。”


王下3:12
> Jehoshaphat said, "The word of the LORD is with him." So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
>
> 约沙法说：“他必有耶和华的话。”于是，以色列王和约沙法并以东王，都下去见他。


王下3:13
> Elisha said to the king of Israel, "What do we have to do with each other? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother." "No," the king of Israel answered, "because it was the LORD who called us three kings together to hand us over to Moab."
>
> 以利沙对以色列王说：“我与你何干？去问你父亲的先知和你母亲的先知吧！”以色列王对他说：“不要这样说，耶和华招聚我们这三王，乃要交在摩押人的手里。”


王下3:14
> Elisha said, "As surely as the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, if I did not have respect for the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not look at you or even notice you.
>
> 以利沙说：“我指着所事奉永生的万军耶和华起誓，我若不看犹大王约沙法的情面，必不理你，不顾你。


王下3:15
> But now bring me a harpist." While the harpist was playing, the hand of the LORD came upon Elisha
>
> 现在你们给我找一个弹琴的来。”弹琴的时候，耶和华的灵（原文作“手”）就降在以利沙身上。


王下3:16
> and he said, "This is what the LORD says: Make this valley full of ditches.
>
> 他便说：“耶和华如此说：‘你们要在这谷中满处挖沟。’


王下3:17
> For this is what the LORD says: You will see neither wind nor rain, yet this valley will be filled with water, and you, your cattle and your other animals will drink.
>
> 因为耶和华如此说：‘你们虽不见风，不见雨，这谷必满了水，使你们和牲畜有水喝。’


王下3:18
> This is an easy thing in the eyes of the LORD; he will also hand Moab over to you.
>
> 在耶和华眼中这还算为小事，他也必将摩押人交在你们手中。


王下3:19
> You will overthrow every fortified city and every major town. You will cut down every good tree, stop up all the springs, and ruin every good field with stones."
>
> 你们必攻破一切坚城美邑，砍伐各种佳树，塞住一切水泉，用石头糟踏一切美田。”


王下3:20
> The next morning, about the time for offering the sacrifice, there it was--water flowing from the direction of Edom! And the land was filled with water.
>
> 次日早晨，约在献祭的时候，有水从以东而来，遍地就满了水。


王下3:21
> Now all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come to fight against them; so every man, young and old, who could bear arms was called up and stationed on the border.
>
> 摩押众人听见这三王上来要与他们争战，凡能顶盔贯甲的，无论老少，尽都聚集，站在边界上。


王下3:22
> When they got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water. To the Moabites across the way, the water looked red--like blood.
>
> 次日早晨，日光照在水上。摩押人起来，看见对面水红如血，


王下3:23
> "That's blood!" they said. "Those kings must have fought and slaughtered each other. Now to the plunder, Moab!"
>
> 就说：“这是血啊！必是三王互相击杀，俱都灭亡。摩押人哪，我们现在去抢夺财物吧！”


王下3:24
> But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and fought them until they fled. And the Israelites invaded the land and slaughtered the Moabites.
>
> 摩押人到了以色列营，以色列人就起来攻打他们，以致他们在以色列人面前逃跑。以色列人往前追杀摩押人，直杀入摩押的境内，


王下3:25
> They destroyed the towns, and each man threw a stone on every good field until it was covered. They stopped up all the springs and cut down every good tree. Only Kir Hareseth was left with its stones in place, but men armed with slings surrounded it and attacked it as well.
>
> 拆毁摩押的城邑。各人抛石填满一切美田，塞住一切水泉，砍伐各种佳树，只剩下吉珥哈列设的石墙，甩石的兵在四围攻打那城。


王下3:26
> When the king of Moab saw that the battle had gone against him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they failed.
>
> 摩押王见阵势甚大，难以对敌，就率领七百拿刀的兵，要冲过阵去到以东王那里，却是不能，


王下3:27
> Then he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him as a sacrifice on the city wall. The fury against Israel was great; they withdrew and returned to their own land.
>
> 便将那应当接续他作王的长子，在城上献为燔祭。以色列人遭遇耶和华的大怒（或作“招人痛恨”），于是三王离开摩押王，各回本国去了。


## 列王纪下第4章
王下4:1
> The wife of a man from the company of the prophets cried out to Elisha, "Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that he revered the LORD. But now his creditor is coming to take my two boys as his slaves."
>
> 有一个先知门徒的妻，哀求以利沙说：“你仆人我丈夫死了，他敬畏耶和华是你所知道的。现在有债主来，要取我两个儿子作奴仆。”


王下4:2
> Elisha replied to her, "How can I help you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?" "Your servant has nothing there at all," she said, "except a little oil."
>
> 以利沙问她说：“我可以为你做什么呢？你告诉我，你家里有什么？”她说：“婢女家中除了一瓶油之外，没有什么。”


王下4:3
> Elisha said, "Go around and ask all your neighbors for empty jars. Don't ask for just a few.
>
> 以利沙说：“你去，向你众邻舍借空器皿，不要少借。


王下4:4
> Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour oil into all the jars, and as each is filled, put it to one side."
>
> 回到家里，关上门，你和你儿子在里面，将油倒在所有的器皿里，倒满了的放在一边。”


王下4:5
> She left him and afterward shut the door behind her and her sons. They brought the jars to her and she kept pouring.
>
> 于是，妇人离开以利沙去了，关上门，自己和儿子在里面。儿子把器皿拿来，她就倒油，


王下4:6
> When all the jars were full, she said to her son, "Bring me another one." But he replied, "There is not a jar left." Then the oil stopped flowing.
>
> 器皿都满了。她对儿子说：“再给我拿器皿来。”儿子说：“再没有器皿了。”油就止住了。


王下4:7
> She went and told the man of God, and he said, "Go, sell the oil and pay your debts. You and your sons can live on what is left."
>
> 妇人去告诉神人。神人说：“你去卖油还债，所剩的，你和你儿子可以靠着度日。”


王下4:8
> One day Elisha went to Shunem. And a well-to-do woman was there, who urged him to stay for a meal. So whenever he came by, he stopped there to eat.
>
> 一日，以利沙走到书念，在那里有一个大户的妇人强留他吃饭。此后，以利沙每从那里经过，就进去吃饭。


王下4:9
> She said to her husband, "I know that this man who often comes our way is a holy man of God.
>
> 妇人对丈夫说：“我看出那常从我们这里经过的是圣洁的神人。


王下4:10
> Let's make a small room on the roof and put in it a bed and a table, a chair and a lamp for him. Then he can stay there whenever he comes to us."
>
> 我们可以为他在墙上盖一间小楼，在其中安放床榻、桌子、椅子、灯台，他来到我们这里，就可以住在其间。”


王下4:11
> One day when Elisha came, he went up to his room and lay down there.
>
> 一日，以利沙来到那里，就进了那楼躺卧。


王下4:12
> He said to his servant Gehazi, "Call the Shunammite." So he called her, and she stood before him.
>
> 以利沙吩咐仆人基哈西说：“你叫这书念妇人来。”他就把妇人叫了来。妇人站在以利沙面前。


王下4:13
> Elisha said to him, "Tell her, 'You have gone to all this trouble for us. Now what can be done for you? Can we speak on your behalf to the king or the commander of the army?'" She replied, "I have a home among my own people."
>
> 以利沙吩咐仆人说：“你对她说：你既为我们费了许多心思，可以为你做什么呢？你向王或元帅有所求的没有？”她回答说：“我在我本乡安居无事。”


王下4:14
> "What can be done for her?" Elisha asked. Gehazi said, "Well, she has no son and her husband is old."
>
> 以利沙对仆人说：“究竟当为她做什么呢？”基哈西说：“她没有儿子，她丈夫也老了。”


王下4:15
> Then Elisha said, "Call her." So he called her, and she stood in the doorway.
>
> 以利沙说：“再叫她来。”于是叫了她来，她就站在门口。


王下4:16
> "About this time next year," Elisha said, "you will hold a son in your arms." "No, my lord," she objected. "Don't mislead your servant, O man of God!"
>
> 以利沙说：“明年到这时候，你必抱一个儿子。”她说：“神人，我主啊！不要那样欺哄婢女。”


王下4:17
> But the woman became pregnant, and the next year about that same time she gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had told her.
>
> 妇人果然怀孕，到了那时候，生了一个儿子，正如以利沙所说的。


王下4:18
> The child grew, and one day he went out to his father, who was with the reapers.
>
> 孩子渐渐长大，一日，到他父亲和收割的人那里。


王下4:19
> "My head! My head!" he said to his father. His father told a servant, "Carry him to his mother."
>
> 他对父亲说：“我的头啊，我的头啊！”他父亲对仆人说：“把他抱到他母亲那里。”


王下4:20
> After the servant had lifted him up and carried him to his mother, the boy sat on her lap until noon, and then he died.
>
> 仆人抱去，交给他母亲，孩子坐在母亲的膝上，到晌午就死了。


王下4:21
> She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, then shut the door and went out.
>
> 他母亲抱他上了楼，将他放在神人的床上，关上门出来，


王下4:22
> She called her husband and said, "Please send me one of the servants and a donkey so I can go to the man of God quickly and return."
>
> 呼叫她丈夫说：“你叫一个仆人给我牵一匹驴来，我要快快地去见神人，就回来。”


王下4:23
> "Why go to him today?" he asked. "It's not the New Moon or the Sabbath." "It's all right," she said.
>
> 丈夫说：“今日不是月朔，也不是安息日，你为何要去见他呢？”妇人说：“平安无事。’”


王下4:24
> She saddled the donkey and said to her servant, "Lead on; don't slow down for me unless I tell you."
>
> 于是备上驴，对仆人说：“你快快赶着走，我若不吩咐你，就不要迟慢。”


王下4:25
> So she set out and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When he saw her in the distance, the man of God said to his servant Gehazi, "Look! There's the Shunammite!
>
> 妇人就往迦密山去见神人。神人远远地看见她，对仆人基哈西说：“看哪！书念的妇人来了。


王下4:26
> Run to meet her and ask her, 'Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your child all right?'" "Everything is all right," she said.
>
> 你跑去迎接她，问她说：‘你平安吗？你丈夫平安吗？孩子平安吗？’”她说：“平安。”


王下4:27
> When she reached the man of God at the mountain, she took hold of his feet. Gehazi came over to push her away, but the man of God said, "Leave her alone! She is in bitter distress, but the LORD has hidden it from me and has not told me why."
>
> 妇人上了山，到神人那里，就抱住神人的脚。基哈西前来要推开她，神人说：“由她吧！因为她心里愁苦，耶和华向我隐瞒，没有指示我。”


王下4:28
> "Did I ask you for a son, my lord?" she said. "Didn't I tell you, 'Don't raise my hopes'?"
>
> 妇人说：“我何尝向我主求过儿子呢？我岂没有说过‘不要欺哄我’吗？”


王下4:29
> Elisha said to Gehazi, "Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand and run. If you meet anyone, do not greet him, and if anyone greets you, do not answer. Lay my staff on the boy's face."
>
> 以利沙吩咐基哈西说：“你束上腰，手拿我的杖前去。若遇见人，不要向他问安；人若向你问安，也不要回答；要把我的杖放在孩子脸上。”


王下4:30
> But the child's mother said, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So he got up and followed her.
>
> 孩子的母亲说：“我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我必不离开你。”于是以利沙起身，随着她去了。


王下4:31
> Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the boy's face, but there was no sound or response. So Gehazi went back to meet Elisha and told him, "The boy has not awakened."
>
> 基哈西先去，把杖放在孩子脸上，却没有声音，也没有动静。基哈西就迎着以利沙回来，告诉他说：“孩子还没有醒过来。”


王下4:32
> When Elisha reached the house, there was the boy lying dead on his couch.
>
> 以利沙来到，进了屋子，看见孩子死了，放在自己的床上。


王下4:33
> He went in, shut the door on the two of them and prayed to the LORD.
>
> 他就关上门，只有自己和孩子在里面。他便祈祷耶和华，


王下4:34
> Then he got on the bed and lay upon the boy, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands. As he stretched himself out upon him, the boy's body grew warm.
>
> 上床伏在孩子身上，口对口、眼对眼、手对手，既伏在孩子身上，孩子的身体就渐渐温和了。


王下4:35
> Elisha turned away and walked back and forth in the room and then got on the bed and stretched out upon him once more. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.
>
> 然后他下来，在屋里来往走了一趟，又上去伏在孩子身上，孩子打了七个喷嚏，就睁开眼睛了。


王下4:36
> Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, "Call the Shunammite." And he did. When she came, he said, "Take your son."
>
> 以利沙叫基哈西说：“你叫这书念妇人来。”于是叫了她来。以利沙说：“将你儿子抱起来！”


王下4:37
> She came in, fell at his feet and bowed to the ground. Then she took her son and went out.
>
> 妇人就进来，在以利沙脚前俯伏于地，抱起她儿子出去了。


王下4:38
> Elisha returned to Gilgal and there was a famine in that region. While the company of the prophets was meeting with him, he said to his servant, "Put on the large pot and cook some stew for these men."
>
> 以利沙又来到吉甲。那地正有饥荒，先知门徒坐在他面前，他吩咐仆人说：“你将大锅放在火上，给先知门徒熬汤。”


王下4:39
> One of them went out into the fields to gather herbs and found a wild vine. He gathered some of its gourds and filled the fold of his cloak. When he returned, he cut them up into the pot of stew, though no one knew what they were.
>
> 有一个人去到田野掐菜，遇见一棵野瓜藤，就摘了一兜野瓜回来，切了搁在熬汤的锅中。因为他们不知道是什么东西，


王下4:40
> The stew was poured out for the men, but as they began to eat it, they cried out, "O man of God, there is death in the pot!" And they could not eat it.
>
> 倒出来给众人吃。吃的时候，都喊叫说：“神人啊，锅中有致死的毒物！”所以众人不能吃了。


王下4:41
> Elisha said, "Get some flour." He put it into the pot and said, "Serve it to the people to eat." And there was nothing harmful in the pot.
>
> 以利沙说：“拿点面来。”就把面撒在锅中说：“倒出来，给众人吃吧！”锅中就没有毒了。


王下4:42
> A man came from Baal Shalishah, bringing the man of God twenty loaves of barley bread baked from the first ripe grain, along with some heads of new grain. "Give it to the people to eat," Elisha said.
>
> 有一个人从巴力沙利沙来，带着初熟大麦做的饼二十个，并新穗子装在口袋里，送给神人。神人说：“把这些给众人吃。”


王下4:43
> "How can I set this before a hundred men?" his servant asked. But Elisha answered, "Give it to the people to eat. For this is what the LORD says: 'They will eat and have some left over.'"
>
> 仆人说：“这一点岂可摆给一百人吃呢？”以利沙说：“你只管给众人吃吧！因为耶和华如此说：‘众人必吃了，还剩下。’”


王下4:44
> Then he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the LORD.
>
> 仆人就摆在众人面前，他们吃了，果然还剩下，正如耶和华所说的。


## 列王纪下第5章
王下5:1
> Now Naaman was commander of the army of the king of Aram. He was a great man in the sight of his master and highly regarded, because through him the LORD had given victory to Aram. He was a valiant soldier, but he had leprosy.
>
> 亚兰王的元帅乃缦，在他主人面前为尊为大，因耶和华曾藉他使亚兰人得胜；他又是大能的勇士，只是长了大麻疯。


王下5:2
> Now bands from Aram had gone out and had taken captive a young girl from Israel, and she served Naaman's wife.
>
> 先前亚兰人成群地出去，从以色列国掳了一个小女子，这女子就服事乃缦的妻。


王下5:3
> She said to her mistress, "If only my master would see the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy."
>
> 她对主母说：“巴不得我主人去见撒马利亚的先知，必能治好他的大麻疯。”


王下5:4
> Naaman went to his master and told him what the girl from Israel had said.
>
> 乃缦进去，告诉他主人说，以色列国的女子如此如此说。


王下5:5
> "By all means, go," the king of Aram replied. "I will send a letter to the king of Israel." So Naaman left, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold and ten sets of clothing.
>
> 亚兰王说：“你可以去，我也达信于以色列王。”于是，乃缦带银子十他连得，金子六千舍客勒，衣裳十套，就去了；


王下5:6
> The letter that he took to the king of Israel read: "With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman to you so that you may cure him of his leprosy."
>
> 且带信给以色列王，信上说：“我打发臣仆乃缦去见你，你接到这信，就要治好他的大麻疯。”


王下5:7
> As soon as the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his robes and said, "Am I God? Can I kill and bring back to life? Why does this fellow send someone to me to be cured of his leprosy? See how he is trying to pick a quarrel with me!"
>
> 以色列王看了信，就撕裂衣服说：“我岂是　神，能使人死、使人活呢？这人竟打发人来，叫我治好他的大麻疯。你们看一看，这人何以寻隙攻击我呢？”


王下5:8
> When Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his robes, he sent him this message: "Why have you torn your robes? Have the man come to me and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel."
>
> 神人以利沙听见以色列王撕裂衣服，就打发人去见王，说：“你为什么撕了衣服呢？可使那人到我这里来，他就知道以色列中有先知了。”


王下5:9
> So Naaman went with his horses and chariots and stopped at the door of Elisha's house.
>
> 于是，乃缦带着车马到了以利沙的家，站在门前。


王下5:10
> Elisha sent a messenger to say to him, "Go, wash yourself seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored and you will be cleansed."
>
> 以利沙打发一个使者对乃缦说：“你去在约旦河中沐浴七回，你的肉就必复原，而得洁净。”


王下5:11
> But Naaman went away angry and said, "I thought that he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, wave his hand over the spot and cure me of my leprosy.
>
> 乃缦却发怒走了，说：“我想他必定出来见我，站着求告耶和华他　神的名，在患处以上摇手，治好这大麻疯。


王下5:12
> Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than any of the waters of Israel? Couldn't I wash in them and be cleansed?" So he turned and went off in a rage.
>
> 大马色的河亚吧拿和法珥法，岂不比以色列的一切水更好吗？我在那里沐浴不得洁净吗？”于是气忿忿地转身去了。


王下5:13
> Naaman's servants went to him and said, "My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more, then, when he tells you, 'Wash and be cleansed'!"
>
> 他的仆人进前来对他说：“我父啊！先知若吩咐你做一件大事，你岂不做吗？何况说你去沐浴而得洁净呢？”


王下5:14
> So he went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, as the man of God had told him, and his flesh was restored and became clean like that of a young boy.
>
> 于是乃缦下去，照着神人的话，在约旦河里沐浴七回，他的肉复原，好像小孩子的肉，他就洁净了。


王下5:15
> Then Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God. He stood before him and said, "Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel. Please accept now a gift from your servant."
>
> 乃缦带着一切跟随他的人，回到神人那里，站在他面前说：“如今我知道，除了以色列之外，普天下没有　神。现在求你收点仆人的礼物。”


王下5:16
> The prophet answered, "As surely as the LORD lives, whom I serve, I will not accept a thing." And even though Naaman urged him, he refused.
>
> 以利沙说：“我指着所事奉永生的耶和华起誓，我必不受。”乃缦再三地求他，他却不受。


王下5:17
> "If you will not," said Naaman, "please let me, your servant, be given as much earth as a pair of mules can carry, for your servant will never again make burnt offerings and sacrifices to any other god but the LORD.
>
> 乃缦说：“你若不肯受，请将两骡子驮的土赐给仆人。从今以后，仆人必不再将燔祭或平安祭献与别　神，只献给耶和华。


王下5:18
> But may the LORD forgive your servant for this one thing: When my master enters the temple of Rimmon to bow down and he is leaning on my arm and I bow there also--when I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the LORD forgive your servant for this."
>
> 惟有一件事，愿耶和华饶恕你仆人：我主人进临门庙叩拜的时候，我用手搀他在临门庙，我也屈身。我在临门庙屈身的这事，愿耶和华饶恕我。”


王下5:19
> "Go in peace," Elisha said. After Naaman had traveled some distance,
>
> 以利沙对他说：“你可以平平安安地回去。”乃缦就离开他去了，走了不远，


王下5:20
> Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said to himself, "My master was too easy on Naaman, this Aramean, by not accepting from him what he brought. As surely as the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something from him."
>
> 神人以利沙的仆人基哈西心里说：“我主人不愿从这亚兰人乃缦手里受他带来的礼物，我指着永生的耶和华起誓，我必跑去追上他，向他要些。”


王下5:21
> So Gehazi hurried after Naaman. When Naaman saw him running toward him, he got down from the chariot to meet him. "Is everything all right?" he asked.
>
> 于是基哈西追赶乃缦。乃缦看见有人追赶，就急忙下车迎着他说：“都平安吗？”


王下5:22
> "Everything is all right," Gehazi answered. "My master sent me to say, 'Two young men from the company of the prophets have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two sets of clothing.'"
>
> 说：“都平安。我主人打发我来说：刚才有两个少年人，是先知门徒，从以法莲山地来见我。请你赐他们一他连得银子，两套衣裳。”


王下5:23
> "By all means, take two talents," said Naaman. He urged Gehazi to accept them, and then tied up the two talents of silver in two bags, with two sets of clothing. He gave them to two of his servants, and they carried them ahead of Gehazi.
>
> 乃缦说：“请受二他连得。”再三地请受，便将二他连得银子装在两个口袋里，又将两套衣裳交给两个仆人，他们就在基哈西前头抬着走。


王下5:24
> When Gehazi came to the hill, he took the things from the servants and put them away in the house. He sent the men away and they left.
>
> 到了山冈，基哈西从他们手中接过来，放在屋里，打发他们回去。


王下5:25
> Then he went in and stood before his master Elisha. "Where have you been, Gehazi?" Elisha asked. "Your servant didn't go anywhere," Gehazi answered.
>
> 基哈西进去，站在他主人面前。以利沙问他说：“基哈西你从哪里来？”回答说：“仆人没有往哪里去。”


王下5:26
> But Elisha said to him, "Was not my spirit with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to take money, or to accept clothes, olive groves, vineyards, flocks, herds, or menservants and maidservants?
>
> 以利沙对他说：“那人下车转回迎你的时候，我的心岂没有去呢？这岂是受银子、衣裳、买橄榄园、葡萄园、牛羊、仆婢的时候呢？


王下5:27
> Naaman's leprosy will cling to you and to your descendants forever." Then Gehazi went from Elisha's presence and he was leprous, as white as snow.
>
> 因此，乃缦的大麻疯必沾染你和你的后裔，直到永远。”基哈西从以利沙面前退出去，就长了大麻疯，像雪那样白。


## 列王纪下第6章
王下6:1
> The company of the prophets said to Elisha, "Look, the place where we meet with you is too small for us.
>
> 先知门徒对以利沙说：“看哪，我们同你所住的地方过于窄小，


王下6:2
> Let us go to the Jordan, where each of us can get a pole; and let us build a place there for us to live." And he said, "Go."
>
> 求你容我们往约旦河去，各人从那里取一根木料建造房屋居住。”他说：“你们去吧！”


王下6:3
> Then one of them said, "Won't you please come with your servants?" "I will," Elisha replied.
>
> 有一人说：“求你与仆人同去。”回答说：“我可以去。”


王下6:4
> And he went with them. They went to the Jordan and began to cut down trees.
>
> 于是以利沙与他们同去。到了约旦河，就砍伐树木。


王下6:5
> As one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron axhead fell into the water. "Oh, my lord," he cried out, "it was borrowed!"
>
> 有一人砍树的时候，斧头掉在水里，他就呼叫说：“哀哉！我主啊，这斧子是借的。”


王下6:6
> The man of God asked, "Where did it fall?" When he showed him the place, Elisha cut a stick and threw it there, and made the iron float.
>
> 神人问说：“掉在哪里了？”他将那地方指给以利沙看。以利沙砍了一根木头，抛在水里，斧头就漂上来了。


王下6:7
> "Lift it out," he said. Then the man reached out his hand and took it.
>
> 以利沙说：“拿起来吧！”那人就伸手拿起来了。


王下6:8
> Now the king of Aram was at war with Israel. After conferring with his officers, he said, "I will set up my camp in such and such a place."
>
> 亚兰王与以色列人争战，和他的臣仆商议说：“我要在某处某处安营。”


王下6:9
> The man of God sent word to the king of Israel: "Beware of passing that place, because the Arameans are going down there."
>
> 神人打发人去见以色列王说：“你要谨慎，不要从某处经过，因为亚兰人从那里下来了。”


王下6:10
> So the king of Israel checked on the place indicated by the man of God. Time and again Elisha warned the king, so that he was on his guard in such places.
>
> 以色列王差人去窥探神人所告诉所警戒他去的地方，就防备未受其害，不止一两次。


王下6:11
> This enraged the king of Aram. He summoned his officers and demanded of them, "Will you not tell me which of us is on the side of the king of Israel?"
>
> 亚兰王因这事心里惊疑，召了臣仆来，对他们说：“我们这里有谁帮助以色列王，你们不指给我吗？”


王下6:12
> "None of us, my lord the king," said one of his officers, "but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the very words you speak in your bedroom."
>
> 有一个臣仆说：“我主我王，无人帮助他，只有以色列中的先知以利沙，将王在卧房所说的话，告诉以色列王了。”


王下6:13
> "Go, find out where he is," the king ordered, "so I can send men and capture him." The report came back: "He is in Dothan."
>
> 王说：“你们去探他在哪里，我好打发人去捉拿他。”有人告诉王说：“他在多坍”。


王下6:14
> Then he sent horses and chariots and a strong force there. They went by night and surrounded the city.
>
> 王就打发车马和大军往那里去。夜间到了，围困那城。


王下6:15
> When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. "Oh, my lord, what shall we do?" the servant asked.
>
> 神人的仆人清早起来出去，看见车马军兵围困了城。仆人对神人说：“哀哉！我主啊，我们怎样行才好呢？”


王下6:16
> "Don't be afraid," the prophet answered. "Those who are with us are more than those who are with them."
>
> 神人说：“不要惧怕！与我们同在的，比与他们同在的更多。”


王下6:17
> And Elisha prayed, "O LORD, open his eyes so he may see." Then the LORD opened the servant's eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
>
> 以利沙祷告说：“耶和华啊，求你开这少年人的眼目，使他能看见。”耶和华开他的眼目，他就看见满山有火车火马围绕以利沙。


王下6:18
> As the enemy came down toward him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, "Strike these people with blindness." So he struck them with blindness, as Elisha had asked.
>
> 敌人下到以利沙那里，以利沙祷告耶和华说：“求你使这些人的眼目昏迷。”耶和华就照以利沙的话，使他们的眼目昏迷。


王下6:19
> Elisha told them, "This is not the road and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you are looking for." And he led them to Samaria.
>
> 以利沙对他们说：“这不是那道，也不是那城，你们跟我去，我必领你们到所寻找的人那里。”于是领他们到了撒马利亚。


王下6:20
> After they entered the city, Elisha said, "LORD, open the eyes of these men so they can see." Then the LORD opened their eyes and they looked, and there they were, inside Samaria.
>
> 他们进了撒马利亚。以利沙祷告说：“耶和华啊，求你开这些人的眼目，使他们能看见。”耶和华开他们的眼目，他们就看见了。不料，是在撒马利亚的城中。


王下6:21
> When the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, "Shall I kill them, my father? Shall I kill them?"
>
> 以色列王见了他们。就问以利沙说：“我父啊，我可以击杀他们吗？”


王下6:22
> "Do not kill them," he answered. "Would you kill men you have captured with your own sword or bow? Set food and water before them so that they may eat and drink and then go back to their master."
>
> 回答说：“不可击杀他们。就是你用刀用弓掳来的，岂可击杀他们吗（或作“也不可击杀，何况这些人呢”）？当在他们面前设摆饮食，使他们吃喝，回到他们的主人那里。”


王下6:23
> So he prepared a great feast for them, and after they had finished eating and drinking, he sent them away, and they returned to their master. So the bands from Aram stopped raiding Israel's territory.
>
> 王就为他们预备了许多食物。他们吃喝完了，打发他们回到他们主人那里。从此，亚兰军不再犯以色列境了。


王下6:24
> Some time later, Ben-Hadad king of Aram mobilized his entire army and marched up and laid siege to Samaria.
>
> 此后，亚兰王便哈达聚集他的全军，上来围困撒马利亚。


王下6:25
> There was a great famine in the city; the siege lasted so long that a donkey's head sold for eighty shekels of silver, and a quarter of a cab of seed pods for five shekels.
>
> 于是撒马利亚被围困，有饥荒，甚至一个驴头值银八十舍客勒，二升鸽子粪值银五舍客勒。


王下6:26
> As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, "Help me, my lord the king!"
>
> 一日，以色列王在城上经过，有一个妇人向他呼叫说：“我主我王啊，求你帮助！”


王下6:27
> The king replied, "If the LORD does not help you, where can I get help for you? From the threshing floor? From the winepress?"
>
> 王说：“耶和华不帮助你，我从何处帮助你？是从禾场，是从酒榨呢？”


王下6:28
> Then he asked her, "What's the matter?" She answered, "This woman said to me, 'Give up your son so we may eat him today, and tomorrow we'll eat my son.'
>
> 王问妇人说：“你有什么苦处？”她回答说：“这妇人对我说：‘将你的儿子取来，我们今日可以吃，明日可以吃我的儿子。’


王下6:29
> So we cooked my son and ate him. The next day I said to her, 'Give up your son so we may eat him,' but she had hidden him."
>
> 我们就煮了我的儿子吃了。次日，我对她说：‘要将你的儿子取来，我们可以吃。’她却将她的儿子藏起来了。”


王下6:30
> When the king heard the woman's words, he tore his robes. As he went along the wall, the people looked, and there, underneath, he had sackcloth on his body.
>
> 王听见妇人的话，就撕裂衣服（王在城上经过），百姓看见王贴身穿着麻衣。


王下6:31
> He said, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today!"
>
> 王说：“我今日若容沙法的儿子以利沙的头仍在他项上，愿　神重重地降罚与我！”


王下6:32
> Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a messenger ahead, but before he arrived, Elisha said to the elders, "Don't you see how this murderer is sending someone to cut off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold it shut against him. Is not the sound of his master's footsteps behind him?"
>
> 那时，以利沙正坐在家中，长老也与他同坐。王打发一个伺候他的人去，他还没有到，以利沙对长老说：“你们看这凶手之子，打发人来斩我的头。你们看着使者来到，就关上门，用门将他推出去。在他后头不是有他主人脚步的响声吗？”


王下6:33
> While he was still talking to them, the messenger came down to him. And the king said, "This disaster is from the LORD. Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?"
>
> 正说话的时候，使者来到，王也到了说：“这灾祸是从耶和华那里来的，我何必再仰望耶和华呢？”


## 列王纪下第7章
王下7:1
> Elisha said, "Hear the word of the LORD. This is what the LORD says: About this time tomorrow, a seah of flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria."
>
> 以利沙说：“你们要听耶和华的话。耶和华如此说：明日约到这时候，在撒马利亚城门口，一细亚细面要卖银一舍客勒，二细亚大麦也要卖银一舍客勒。”


王下7:2
> The officer on whose arm the king was leaning said to the man of God, "Look, even if the LORD should open the floodgates of the heavens, could this happen?" "You will see it with your own eyes," answered Elisha, "but you will not eat any of it!"
>
> 有一个搀扶王的军长对神人说：“即便耶和华使天开了窗户，也不能有这事。”以利沙说：“你必亲眼看见，却不得吃。”


王下7:3
> Now there were four men with leprosy at the entrance of the city gate. They said to each other, "Why stay here until we die?
>
> 在城门那里有四个长大麻疯的人，他们彼此说：“我们为何坐在这里等死呢？


王下7:4
> If we say, 'We'll go into the city'--the famine is there, and we will die. And if we stay here, we will die. So let's go over to the camp of the Arameans and surrender. If they spare us, we live; if they kill us, then we die."
>
> 我们若说‘进城去吧’，城里有饥荒，必死在那里；若在这里坐着不动，也必是死。来吧！我们去投降亚兰人的军队，他们若留我们的活命，就活着；若杀我们，就死了吧！”


王下7:5
> At dusk they got up and went to the camp of the Arameans. When they reached the edge of the camp, not a man was there,
>
> 黄昏的时候，他们起来往亚兰人的营盘去；到了营边，不见一人在那里。


王下7:6
> for the Lord had caused the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots and horses and a great army, so that they said to one another, "Look, the king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to attack us!"
>
> 因为主使亚兰人的军队听见车马的声音，是大军的声音。他们就彼此说：“这必是以色列王贿买赫人的诸王和埃及人的诸王来攻击我们。”


王下7:7
> So they got up and fled in the dusk and abandoned their tents and their horses and donkeys. They left the camp as it was and ran for their lives.
>
> 所以，在黄昏的时候，他们起来逃跑，撇下帐棚、马、驴，营盘照旧，只顾逃命。


王下7:8
> The men who had leprosy reached the edge of the camp and entered one of the tents. They ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold and clothes, and went off and hid them. They returned and entered another tent and took some things from it and hid them also.
>
> 那些长大麻疯的到了营边，进了帐棚，吃了喝了，且从其中拿出金银和衣服来，去收藏了；回来又进了一座帐棚，从其中拿出财物来，去收藏了。


王下7:9
> Then they said to each other, "We're not doing right. This is a day of good news and we are keeping it to ourselves. If we wait until daylight, punishment will overtake us. Let's go at once and report this to the royal palace."
>
> 那时，他们彼此说：“我们所做的不好！今日是有好信息的日子，我们竟不作声！若等到天亮，罪必临到我们。来吧，我们与王家报信去！”


王下7:10
> So they went and called out to the city gatekeepers and told them, "We went into the Aramean camp and not a man was there--not a sound of anyone--only tethered horses and donkeys, and the tents left just as they were."
>
> 他们就去叫守城门的，告诉他们说：“我们到了亚兰人的营，不见一人在那里，也无人声，只有拴着的马和驴，帐棚都照旧。”


王下7:11
> The gatekeepers shouted the news, and it was reported within the palace.
>
> 守城门的叫了众守门的人来，他们就进去与王家报信。


王下7:12
> The king got up in the night and said to his officers, "I will tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know we are starving; so they have left the camp to hide in the countryside, thinking, 'They will surely come out, and then we will take them alive and get into the city.'"
>
> 王夜间起来，对臣仆说：“我告诉你们亚兰人向我们如何行：他们知道我们饥饿，所以离营，埋伏在田野说：‘以色列人出城的时候，我们就活捉他们，得以进城。’”


王下7:13
> One of his officers answered, "Have some men take five of the horses that are left in the city. Their plight will be like that of all the Israelites left here--yes, they will only be like all these Israelites who are doomed. So let us send them to find out what happened."
>
> 有一个臣仆对王说：“我们不如用城里剩下之马中的五匹马（马和城里剩下的以色列人都是一样，快要灭绝），打发人去窥探。”


王下7:14
> So they selected two chariots with their horses, and the king sent them after the Aramean army. He commanded the drivers, "Go and find out what has happened."
>
> 于是取了两辆车和马，王差人去追寻亚兰军说：“你们去窥探窥探。”


王下7:15
> They followed them as far as the Jordan, and they found the whole road strewn with the clothing and equipment the Arameans had thrown away in their headlong flight. So the messengers returned and reported to the king.
>
> 他们就追寻到约旦河，看见满道上都是亚兰人急跑时丢弃的衣服器具。使者就回来报告王。


王下7:16
> Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. So a seah of flour sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley sold for a shekel, as the LORD had said.
>
> 众人就出去，掳掠亚兰人的营盘。于是一细亚细面卖银一舍客勒，二细亚大麦也卖银一舍客勒，正如耶和华所说的。


王下7:17
> Now the king had put the officer on whose arm he leaned in charge of the gate, and the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died, just as the man of God had foretold when the king came down to his house.
>
> 王派搀扶他的那军长，在城门口弹压，众人在那里将他践踏，他就死了，正如神人在王下来见他的时候所说的。


王下7:18
> It happened as the man of God had said to the king: "About this time tomorrow, a seah of flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria."
>
> 神人曾对王说：“明日约到这时候，在撒马利亚城门口，二细亚大麦要卖银一舍客勒，一细亚细面也要卖银一舍客勒。”


王下7:19
> The officer had said to the man of God, "Look, even if the LORD should open the floodgates of the heavens, could this happen?" The man of God had replied, "You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it!"
>
> 那军长对神人说：“即便耶和华使天开了窗户，也不能有这事。”神人说：“你必亲眼看见，却不得吃。”


王下7:20
> And that is exactly what happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died.
>
> 这话果然应验在他身上，因为众人在城门口将他践踏，他就死了。


## 列王纪下第8章
王下8:1
> Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life, "Go away with your family and stay for a while wherever you can, because the LORD has decreed a famine in the land that will last seven years."
>
> 以利沙曾对所救活之子的那妇人说：“你和你的全家，要起身往你可住的地方去住，因为耶和华命饥荒降在这地七年。”


王下8:2
> The woman proceeded to do as the man of God said. She and her family went away and stayed in the land of the Philistines seven years.
>
> 妇人就起身，照神人的话，带着全家往非利士地去，住了七年。


王下8:3
> At the end of the seven years she came back from the land of the Philistines and went to the king to beg for her house and land.
>
> 七年完了，那妇人从非利士地回来，就出去为自己的房屋田地哀告王。


王下8:4
> The king was talking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, and had said, "Tell me about all the great things Elisha has done."
>
> 那时，王正与神人的仆人基哈西说：“请你将以利沙所行的一切大事告诉我。”


王下8:5
> Just as Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had restored the dead to life, the woman whose son Elisha had brought back to life came to beg the king for her house and land. Gehazi said, "This is the woman, my lord the king, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life."
>
> 基哈西告诉王以利沙如何使死人复活，恰巧以利沙所救活她儿子的那妇人，为自己的房屋田地来哀告王。基哈西说：“我主我王，这就是那妇人，这是她的儿子，就是以利沙所救活的。”


王下8:6
> The king asked the woman about it, and she told him. Then he assigned an official to her case and said to him, "Give back everything that belonged to her, including all the income from her land from the day she left the country until now."
>
> 王问那妇人，她就把那事告诉王。于是王为她派一个太监，说：“凡属这妇人的都还给她，自从她离开本地直到今日，她田地的出产也都还给她。”


王下8:7
> Elisha went to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad king of Aram was ill. When the king was told, "The man of God has come all the way up here,"
>
> 以利沙来到大马色，亚兰王便哈达正患病。有人告诉王说：“神人来到这里了。”


王下8:8
> he said to Hazael, "Take a gift with you and go to meet the man of God. Consult the LORD through him; ask him, 'Will I recover from this illness?'"
>
> 王就吩咐哈薛说：“你带着礼物去见神人，托他求问耶和华，我这病能好不能好？”


王下8:9
> Hazael went to meet Elisha, taking with him as a gift forty camel-loads of all the finest wares of Damascus. He went in and stood before him, and said, "Your son Ben-Hadad king of Aram has sent me to ask, 'Will I recover from this illness?'"
>
> 于是，哈薛用四十个骆驼，驮着大马色的各样美物为礼物，去见以利沙。到了他那里，站在他面前说：“你儿子亚兰王便哈达打发我来见你，他问说：‘我这病能好不能好？’”


王下8:10
> Elisha answered, "Go and say to him, 'You will certainly recover'; but the LORD has revealed to me that he will in fact die."
>
> 以利沙对哈薛说：“你回去告诉他说：‘这病必能好’；但耶和华指示我，他必要死。”


王下8:11
> He stared at him with a fixed gaze until Hazael felt ashamed. Then the man of God began to weep.
>
> 神人定睛看着哈薛，甚致他惭愧。神人就哭了。


王下8:12
> "Why is my lord weeping?" asked Hazael. "Because I know the harm you will do to the Israelites," he answered. "You will set fire to their fortified places, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little children to the ground, and rip open their pregnant women."
>
> 哈薛说：“我主为什么哭？”回答说：“因为我知道你必苦害以色列人，用火焚烧他们的保障，用刀杀死他们的壮丁，摔死他们的婴孩，剖开他们的孕妇。”


王下8:13
> Hazael said, "How could your servant, a mere dog, accomplish such a feat?" "The LORD has shown me that you will become king of Aram," answered Elisha.
>
> 哈薛说：“你仆人算什么，不过是一条狗，焉能行这大事呢？”以利沙回答说：“耶和华指示我，你必作亚兰王。”


王下8:14
> Then Hazael left Elisha and returned to his master. When Ben-Hadad asked, "What did Elisha say to you?" Hazael replied, "He told me that you would certainly recover."
>
> 哈薛离开以利沙，回去见他的主人。主人问他说：“以利沙对你说什么？”回答说：“他告诉我你必能好。”


王下8:15
> But the next day he took a thick cloth, soaked it in water and spread it over the king's face, so that he died. Then Hazael succeeded him as king.
>
> 次日，哈薛拿被窝浸在水中，蒙住王的脸，王就死了。于是哈薛篡了他的位。


王下8:16
> In the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, when Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat began his reign as king of Judah.
>
> 以色列王亚哈的儿子约兰第五年，犹大王约沙法还在位的时候，约沙法的儿子约兰登基，作了犹大王。


王下8:17
> He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.
>
> 约兰登基的时候年三十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王八年。


王下8:18
> He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the LORD.
>
> 他行以色列诸王所行的，与亚哈家一样；因为他娶了亚哈的女儿为妻，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事。


王下8:19
> Nevertheless, for the sake of his servant David, the LORD was not willing to destroy Judah. He had promised to maintain a lamp for David and his descendants forever.
>
> 耶和华却因他仆人大卫的缘故，仍不肯灭绝犹大，照他所应许大卫的话，永远赐灯光与他的子孙。


王下8:20
> In the time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king.
>
> 约兰年间，以东人背叛犹大，脱离他的权下，自己立王。


王下8:21
> So Jehoram went to Zair with all his chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he rose up and broke through by night; his army, however, fled back home.
>
> 约兰率领所有的战车往撒益去，夜间起来，攻打围困他的以东人和车兵长。犹大兵就逃跑，各回各家去了。


王下8:22
> To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah. Libnah revolted at the same time.
>
> 这样，以东人背叛犹大，脱离他的权下，直到今日。那时，立拿人也背叛了。


王下8:23
> As for the other events of Jehoram's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
>
> 约兰其余的事，凡他所行的，都写在犹大列王记上。


王下8:24
> Jehoram rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king.
>
> 约兰与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫城他列祖的坟地里。他儿子亚哈谢接续他作王。


王下8:25
> In the twelfth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.
>
> 以色列王亚哈的儿子约兰十二年，犹大王约兰的儿子亚哈谢登基。


王下8:26
> Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother's name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel.
>
> 他登基的时候年二十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王一年。他母亲名叫亚她利雅，是以色列王暗利的孙女。


王下8:27
> He walked in the ways of the house of Ahab and did evil in the eyes of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done, for he was related by marriage to Ahab's family.
>
> 亚哈谢效法亚哈家，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，与亚哈家一样。因为他是亚哈家的女婿。


王下8:28
> Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram;
>
> 他与亚哈的儿子约兰同往基列的拉末去，与亚兰王哈薛争战，亚兰人打伤了约兰，


王下8:29
> so King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramoth in his battle with Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Joram son of Ahab, because he had been wounded.
>
> 约兰王回到耶斯列，医治在拉末与亚兰王哈薛打仗的时候所受的伤。犹大王约兰的儿子亚哈谢因为亚哈的儿子约兰病了，就下到耶斯列看望他。


## 列王纪下第9章
王下9:1
> The prophet Elisha summoned a man from the company of the prophets and said to him, "Tuck your cloak into your belt, take this flask of oil with you and go to Ramoth Gilead.
>
> 先知以利沙叫了一个先知门徒来，吩咐他说：“你束上腰，手拿这瓶膏油，往基列的拉末去。


王下9:2
> When you get there, look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go to him, get him away from his companions and take him into an inner room.
>
> 到了那里，要寻找宁示的孙子、约沙法的儿子耶户。使他从同僚中起来，带他进严密的屋子，


王下9:3
> Then take the flask and pour the oil on his head and declare, 'This is what the LORD says: I anoint you king over Israel.' Then open the door and run; don't delay!"
>
> 将瓶里的膏油倒在他头上说：‘耶和华如此说：我膏你作以色列王。’说完了，就开门逃跑，不要迟延。”


王下9:4
> So the young man, the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead.
>
> 于是那少年先知往基列的拉末去了。


王下9:5
> When he arrived, he found the army officers sitting together. "I have a message for you, commander," he said. "For which of us?" asked Jehu. "For you, commander," he replied.
>
> 到了那里，看见众军长都坐着，就说：“将军哪，我有话对你说。”耶户说：“我们众人里，你要对哪一个说呢？”回答说：“将军哪，我要对你说。”


王下9:6
> Jehu got up and went into the house. Then the prophet poured the oil on Jehu's head and declared, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'I anoint you king over the LORD'S people Israel.
>
> 耶户就起来，进了屋子，少年人将膏油倒在他头上，对他说：“耶和华以色列的　神如此说：‘我膏你作耶和华民以色列的王。


王下9:7
> You are to destroy the house of Ahab your master, and I will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the LORD'S servants shed by Jezebel.

> 你要击杀你主人亚哈的全家，我好在耶洗别身上伸我仆人众先知和耶和华一切仆人流血的冤。


王下9:8
> The whole house of Ahab will perish. I will cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel--slave or free.
>
> 亚哈全家必都灭亡；凡属亚哈的男丁，无论是困住的、自由的，我必从以色列中剪除，


王下9:9
> I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah.
>
> 使亚哈的家像尼八儿子耶罗波安的家，又像亚希雅儿子巴沙的家。


王下9:10
> As for Jezebel, dogs will devour her on the plot of ground at Jezreel, and no one will bury her.'" Then he opened the door and ran.
>
> 耶洗别必在耶斯列田里被狗所吃，无人葬埋。’”说完了，少年人就开门逃跑了。


王下9:11
> When Jehu went out to his fellow officers, one of them asked him, "Is everything all right? Why did this madman come to you?" "You know the man and the sort of things he says," Jehu replied.
>
> 耶户出来，回到他主人的臣仆那里，有一人问他说：“平安吗？这狂妄的人来见你有什么事呢？”回答说：“你们认得那人，也知道他说什么。”


王下9:12
> "That's not true!" they said. "Tell us." Jehu said, "Here is what he told me: 'This is what the LORD says: I anoint you king over Israel.'"
>
> 他们说：“这是假话，你据实地告诉我们。”回答说：“他如此如此对我说。他说：‘耶和华如此说：我膏你作以色列王。’”


王下9:13
> They hurried and took their cloaks and spread them under him on the bare steps. Then they blew the trumpet and shouted, "Jehu is king!"
>
> 他们就急忙各将自己的衣服铺在上层台阶，使耶户坐在其上。他们吹角说：“耶户作王了！”


王下9:14
> So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth Gilead against Hazael king of Aram,

> 这样，宁示的孙子、约沙法的儿子耶户，背叛约兰。先是约兰和以色列众人因为亚兰王哈薛的缘故，把守基列的拉末，


王下9:15
> but King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him in the battle with Hazael king of Aram.) Jehu said, "If this is the way you feel, don't let anyone slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel."
>
> 但约兰王回到耶斯列，医治与亚兰王哈薛打仗所受的伤。耶户说：“若合你们的意思，就不容人逃出城往耶斯列报信去。”


王下9:16
> Then he got into his chariot and rode to Jezreel, because Joram was resting there and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him.

> 于是耶户坐车往耶斯列去，因为约兰病卧在那里。犹大王亚哈谢已经下去看望他。


王下9:17
> When the lookout standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu's troops approaching, he called out, "I see some troops coming." "Get a horseman," Joram ordered. "Send him to meet them and ask, 'Do you come in peace?'"
>
> 有一个守望的人站在耶斯列的楼上，看见耶户带着一群人来，就说：“我看见一群人。”约兰说：“打发一个骑马的去迎接他们，问说：‘平安不平安？’”


王下9:18
> The horseman rode off to meet Jehu and said, "This is what the king says: 'Do you come in peace?'" "What do you have to do with peace?" Jehu replied. "Fall in behind me." The lookout reported, "The messenger has reached them, but he isn't coming back."
>
> 骑马的就去迎接耶户说：“王问说：‘平安不平安？’”耶户说：“平安不平安与你何干？你转在我后头吧！”守望的人又说：“使者到了他们那里，却不回来。”


王下9:19
> So the king sent out a second horseman. When he came to them he said, "This is what the king says: 'Do you come in peace?'" Jehu replied, "What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me."
>
> 王又打发一个骑马的去。这人到了他们那里说：“王问说：‘平安不平安？’”耶户说：“平安不平安与你何干？你转在我后头吧！”


王下9:20
> The lookout reported, "He has reached them, but he isn't coming back either. The driving is like that of Jehu son of Nimshi--he drives like a madman."
>
> 守望的人又说：“他到了他们那里，也不回来。车赶得甚猛，像宁示的孙子耶户的赶法。”


王下9:21
> "Hitch up my chariot," Joram ordered. And when it was hitched up, Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah rode out, each in his own chariot, to meet Jehu. They met him at the plot of ground that had belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite.
>
> 约兰吩咐说：“套车！”人就给他套车。以色列王约兰和犹大王亚哈谢，各坐自己的车出去迎接耶户，在耶斯列人拿伯的田那里遇见他。


王下9:22
> When Joram saw Jehu he asked, "Have you come in peace, Jehu?" "How can there be peace," Jehu replied, "as long as all the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound?"
>
> 约兰见耶户就说：“耶户啊，平安吗？”耶户说：“你母亲耶洗别的淫行邪术这样多，焉能平安呢？”


王下9:23
> Joram turned about and fled, calling out to Ahaziah, "Treachery, Ahaziah!"
>
> 约兰就转车逃跑，对亚哈谢说：“亚哈谢啊，反了！”


王下9:24
> Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart and he slumped down in his chariot.
>
> 耶户开满了弓，射中约兰的脊背，箭从心窝穿出，约兰就仆倒在车上。


王下9:25
> Jehu said to Bidkar, his chariot officer, "Pick him up and throw him on the field that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember how you and I were riding together in chariots behind Ahab his father when the LORD made this prophecy about him:

>
> 说：‘我昨日看见拿伯的血和他众子的血，我必在这块田上报应你。’这是耶和华说的。现在你要照着耶和华的话，把他抛在这田间。”


王下9:27
> When Ahaziah king of Judah saw what had happened, he fled up the road to Beth Haggan. Jehu chased him, shouting, "Kill him too!" They wounded him in his chariot on the way up to Gur near Ibleam, but he escaped to Megiddo and died there.
>
> 犹大王亚哈谢见这光景，就从园亭之路逃跑。耶户追赶他说：“把这人也杀在车上。”到了靠近以伯莲姑珥的坡上击伤了他，他逃到米吉多，就死在那里。


王下9:28
> His servants took him by chariot to Jerusalem and buried him with his fathers in his tomb in the City of David.

> 他的臣仆用车将他的尸首送到耶路撒冷，葬在大卫城他自己的坟墓里，与他列祖同葬。


王下9:29
> (In the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king of Judah.)
>
> 亚哈谢登基作犹大王的时候，是在亚哈的儿子约兰第十一年。


王下9:30
> Then Jehu went to Jezreel. When Jezebel heard about it, she painted her eyes, arranged her hair and looked out of a window.
>
> 耶户到了耶斯列。耶洗别听见就擦粉、梳头，从窗户里往外观看。


王下9:31
> As Jehu entered the gate, she asked, "Have you come in peace, Zimri, you murderer of your master?"
>
> 耶户进门的时候，耶洗别说：“杀主人的心利啊，平安吗？”


王下9:32
> He looked up at the window and called out, "Who is on my side? Who?" Two or three eunuchs looked down at him.
>
> 耶户抬头向窗户观看说：“谁顺从我？”有两三个太监从窗户往外看他。


王下9:33
> "Throw her down!" Jehu said. So they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered the wall and the horses as they trampled her underfoot.
>
> 耶户说：“把她扔下来！”他们就把她扔下来。她的血溅在墙上和马上，于是把她践踏了。


王下9:34
> Jehu went in and ate and drank. "Take care of that cursed woman," he said, "and bury her, for she was a king's daughter."
>
> 耶户进去，吃了喝了，吩咐说：“你们把这被咒诅的妇人葬埋了，因为她是王的女儿。”


王下9:35
> But when they went out to bury her, they found nothing except her skull, her feet and her hands.
>
> 他们就去葬埋她，只寻得她的头骨和脚并手掌。


王下9:36
> They went back and told Jehu, who said, "This is the word of the LORD that he spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite: On the plot of ground at Jezreel dogs will devour Jezebel's flesh.
>
> 他们回去告诉耶户，耶户说：“这正应验耶和华藉他仆人提斯比人以利亚所说的话，说：在耶斯列田间，狗必吃耶洗别的肉；


王下9:37
> Jezebel's body will be like refuse on the ground in the plot at Jezreel, so that no one will be able to say, 'This is Jezebel.'"

> 耶洗别的尸首必在耶斯列田间如同粪土，甚至人不能说：‘这是耶洗别。’”


## 列王纪下第10章
王下10:1
> Now there were in Samaria seventy sons of the house of Ahab. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria: to the officials of Jezreel, to the elders and to the guardians of Ahab's children. He said,

王下10:4
> But they were terrified and said, "If two kings could not resist him, how can we?"
>
> 他们却甚惧怕，彼此说：“二王在他面前尚且站立不住，我们怎能站得住呢？”


王下10:5
> So the palace administrator, the city governor, the elders and the guardians sent this message to Jehu: "We are your servants and we will do anything you say. We will not appoint anyone as king; you do whatever you think best."
>
> 家宰、邑宰和长老并教养众子的人，打发人去见耶户说：“我们是你的仆人，凡你所吩咐我们的，都必遵行，我们不立谁作王，你看怎样好就怎样行。”


王下10:6
> Then Jehu wrote them a second letter, saying, "If you are on my side and will obey me, take the heads of your master's sons and come to me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow." Now the royal princes, seventy of them, were with the leading men of the city, who were rearing them.
>
> 耶户又给他们写信说：“你们若归顺我，听从我的话，明日这时候，要将你们主人众子的首级带到耶斯列来见我。”那时，王的儿子七十人，都住在教养他们那城中的尊贵人家里。


王下10:7
> When the letter arrived, these men took the princes and slaughtered all seventy of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel.
>
> 信一到，他们就把王的七十个儿子杀了，将首级装在筐里，送到耶斯列耶户那里。


王下10:8
> When the messenger arrived, he told Jehu, "They have brought the heads of the princes." Then Jehu ordered, "Put them in two piles at the entrance of the city gate until morning."

王下10:9
> The next morning Jehu went out. He stood before all the people and said, "You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these?

> 次日早晨，耶户出来，站着对众民说：“你们都是公义的。我背叛我主人，将他杀了。这些人却是谁杀的呢？


王下10:10

> 由此可知，耶和华指着亚哈家所说的话，一句没有落空，因为耶和华藉他仆人以利亚所说的话都成就了。”


王下10:11
> So Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab, as well as all his chief men, his close friends and his priests, leaving him no survivor.
>
> 凡亚哈家在耶斯列所剩下的人和他的大臣、密友、祭司，耶户尽都杀了，没有留下一个。


王下10:12
> Jehu then set out and went toward Samaria. At Beth Eked of the Shepherds,

> 耶户起身往撒马利亚去。在路上、牧人剪羊毛之处，


王下10:13
> he met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and asked, "Who are you?" They said, "We are relatives of Ahaziah, and we have come down to greet the families of the king and of the queen mother."
>
> 遇见犹大王亚哈谢的弟兄，问他们说：“你们是谁？”回答说：“我们是亚哈谢的弟兄，现在下去，要问王和太后的众子安。”


王下10:14
> "Take them alive!" he ordered. So they took them alive and slaughtered them by the well of Beth Eked--forty-two men. He left no survivor.
>
> 耶户吩咐说：“活捉他们！”跟从的人就活捉了他们，将他们杀在剪羊毛之处的坑边，共四十二人，没有留下一个。


王下10:15
> After he left there, he came upon Jehonadab son of Recab, who was on his way to meet him. Jehu greeted him and said, "Are you in accord with me, as I am with you?" "I am," Jehonadab answered. "If so," said Jehu, "give me your hand." So he did, and Jehu helped him up into the chariot.
>
> 耶户从那里前行，恰遇利甲的儿子约拿达来迎接他，耶户问他安，对他说：“你诚心待我，像我诚心待你吗？”约拿达回答说：“是。”耶户说：“若是这样，你向我伸手。”他就伸手，耶户拉他上车。


王下10:16
> Jehu said, "Come with me and see my zeal for the LORD." Then he had him ride along in his chariot.
>
> 耶户说：“你和我同去，看我为耶和华怎样热心。”于是请他坐在车上。


王下10:17
> When Jehu came to Samaria, he killed all who were left there of Ahab's family; he destroyed them, according to the word of the LORD spoken to Elijah.
>
> 到了撒马利亚，就把撒马利亚亚哈家剩下的人都杀了，直到灭尽，正如耶和华对以利亚所说的。


王下10:18
> Then Jehu brought all the people together and said to them, "Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much.
>
> 耶户招聚众民，对他们说：“亚哈事奉巴力还冷淡，耶户却更热心。


王下10:19
> Now summon all the prophets of Baal, all his ministers and all his priests. See that no one is missing, because I am going to hold a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who fails to come will no longer live." But Jehu was acting deceptively in order to destroy the ministers of Baal.
>
> 现在我要给巴力献大祭。应当叫巴力的众先知和一切拜巴力的人，并巴力的众祭司，都到我这里来，不可缺少一个，凡不来的必不得活。”耶户这样行，是用诡计要杀尽拜巴力的人。


王下10:20
> Jehu said, "Call an assembly in honor of Baal." So they proclaimed it.
>
> 耶户说：“要为巴力宣告严肃会。”于是宣告了。


王下10:21
> Then he sent word throughout Israel, and all the ministers of Baal came; not one stayed away. They crowded into the temple of Baal until it was full from one end to the other.
>
> 耶户差人走遍以色列地，凡拜巴力的人都来齐了，没有一个不来的。他们进了巴力庙，巴力庙中从前边直到后边都满了人。


王下10:22
> And Jehu said to the keeper of the wardrobe, "Bring robes for all the ministers of Baal." So he brought out robes for them.
>
> 耶户吩咐掌管礼服的人说：“拿出礼服来，给一切拜巴力的人穿。”他就拿出礼服来给了他们。


王下10:23
> Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Recab went into the temple of Baal. Jehu said to the ministers of Baal, "Look around and see that no servants of the LORD are here with you--only ministers of Baal."
>
> 耶户和利甲的儿子约拿达进了巴力庙，对拜巴力的人说：“你们察看察看，在你们这里不可有耶和华的仆人，只可容留拜巴力的人。”


王下10:24
> So they went in to make sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had posted eighty men outside with this warning: "If one of you lets any of the men I am placing in your hands escape, it will be your life for his life."
>
> 耶户和约拿达进去献平安祭和燔祭。耶户先安排八十人在庙外，吩咐说：“我将这些人交在你们手中，若有一人脱逃，谁放的，必叫他偿命！”


王下10:25
> As soon as Jehu had finished making the burnt offering, he ordered the guards and officers: "Go in and kill them; let no one escape." So they cut them down with the sword. The guards and officers threw the bodies out and then entered the inner shrine of the temple of Baal.
>
> 耶户献完了燔祭，就出来吩咐护卫兵和众军长说：“你们进去杀他们，不容一人出来。”护卫兵和军长就用刀杀他们，将尸首抛出去，便到巴力庙的城去了，


王下10:26
> They brought the sacred stone out of the temple of Baal and burned it.

> 这样，耶户在以色列中灭了巴力。


王下10:29
> However, he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit--the worship of the golden calves at Bethel and Dan.
>
> 只是耶户不离开尼八的儿子耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪，就是拜伯特利和但的金牛犊。


王下10:30
> The LORD said to Jehu, "Because you have done well in accomplishing what is right in my eyes and have done to the house of Ahab all I had in mind to do, your descendants will sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation."
>
> 耶和华对耶户说：“因你办好我眼中看为正的事，照我的心意待亚哈家，你的子孙必接续你坐以色列的国位，直到四代。”


王下10:31
> Yet Jehu was not careful to keep the law of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, which he had caused Israel to commit.
>
> 只是耶户不尽心遵守耶和华以色列　神的律法，不离开耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪。


王下10:32

>
> 从前以色列王所罗门在耶路撒冷前，邪僻山右边，为西顿人可憎的神亚斯她录、摩押人可憎的神基抹、亚扪人可憎的神米勒公所筑的邱坛，王都污秽了，


王下23:14

>
> 他将伯特利的坛，就是叫以色列人陷在罪里，尼八的儿子耶罗波安所筑的那坛，都拆毁焚烧，打碎成灰，并焚烧了亚舍拉。


王下23:16

>
> 约西亚回头，看见山上的坟墓，就打发人将坟墓里的骸骨取出来，烧在坛上，污秽了坛，正如从前神人宣传耶和华的话。


王下23:17
> The king asked, "What is that tombstone I see?" The men of the city said, "It marks the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and pronounced against the altar of Bethel the very things you have done to it."
>
> 约西亚问说：“我所看见的是什么碑？”那城里的人回答说：“先前有神人从犹大来，预先说王现在向伯特利坛所行的事，这就是他的墓碑。”


王下23:18
> "Leave it alone," he said. "Don't let anyone disturb his bones." So they spared his bones and those of the prophet who had come from Samaria.
>
> 约西亚说：“由他吧！不要挪移他的骸骨。”他们就不动他的骸骨，也不动从撒马利亚来那先知的骸骨。


王下23:19
> Just as he had done at Bethel, Josiah removed and defiled all the shrines at the high places that the kings of Israel had built in the towns of Samaria that had provoked the LORD to anger.
>
> 从前以色列诸王在撒马利亚的城邑建筑邱坛的殿，惹动耶和华的怒气，现在约西亚都废去了，就如他在伯特利所行的一般；


王下23:20

>
> 又将邱坛的祭司都杀在坛上，并在坛上烧人的骨头，就回耶路撒冷去了。

王下23:22
> Not since the days of the judges who led Israel, nor throughout the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah, had any such Passover been observed.
>
> 自从士师治理以色列人和以色列王、犹大王的时候，直到如今，实在没有守过这样的逾越节；


王下23:23
> But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was celebrated to the LORD in Jerusalem.
>
> 只有约西亚王十八年在耶路撒冷向耶和华守这逾越节。


王下23:24
> Furthermore, Josiah got rid of the mediums and spiritists, the household gods, the idols and all the other detestable things seen in Judah and Jerusalem. This he did to fulfill the requirements of the law written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had discovered in the temple of the LORD.
>
> 凡犹大国和耶路撒冷所有交鬼的、行巫术的，与家中的神像和偶像，并一切可憎之物，约西亚尽都除掉，成就了祭司希勒家在耶和华殿里所得律法书上所写的话。


王下23:25
> Neither before nor after Josiah was there a king like him who turned to the LORD as he did--with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength, in accordance with all the Law of Moses.
>
> 在约西亚以前，没有王像他尽心、尽性、尽力地归向耶和华，遵行摩西的一切律法；在他以后，也没有兴起一个王像他。


王下23:26
> Nevertheless, the LORD did not turn away from the heat of his fierce anger, which burned against Judah because of all that Manasseh had done to provoke him to anger.
>
> 然而，耶和华向犹大所发猛烈的怒气仍不止息，是因玛拿西诸事惹动他。


王下23:27
> So the LORD said, "I will remove Judah also from my presence as I removed Israel, and I will reject Jerusalem, the city I chose, and this temple, about which I said, 'There shall my Name be.'"
>
> 耶和华说：“我必将犹大人从我面前赶出，如同赶出以色列人一般，我必弃掉我从前所选择的这城耶路撒冷和我所说立我名的殿。”


王下23:28
