但1:1
> In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.
>
> 犹大王约雅敬在位第三年，巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒来到耶路撒冷，将城围困。


但1:2
> And the Lord delivered Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, along with some of the articles from the temple of God. These he carried off to the temple of his god in Babylonia and put in the treasure house of his god.
>
> 主将犹大王约雅敬，并神殿中器皿的几份交付他手，他就把这器皿带到示拿地，收入他　神的庙里，放在他　神的库中。


但1:3
> Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, chief of his court officials, to bring in some of the Israelites from the royal family and the nobility--
>
> 王吩咐太监长亚施毗拿从以色列人的宗室和贵胄中带进几个人来，


但1:4
> young men without any physical defect, handsome, showing aptitude for every kind of learning, well informed, quick to understand, and qualified to serve in the king's palace. He was to teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians.
>
> 就是年少没有残疾、相貌俊美、通达各样学问、知识聪明俱备、足能侍立在王宫里的，要教他们迦勒底的文字言语。


但1:5
> The king assigned them a daily amount of food and wine from the king's table. They were to be trained for three years, and after that they were to enter the king's service.
>
> 王派定将自己所用的膳和所饮的酒，每日赐他们一份，养他们三年。满了三年，好叫他们在王面前侍立。


但1:6
> Among these were some from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.
>
> 他们中间有犹大族的人但以理、哈拿尼雅、米沙利、亚撒利雅。


但1:7
> The chief official gave them new names: to Daniel, the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego.
>
> 太监长给他们起名，称但以理为伯提沙撒，称哈拿尼雅为沙得拉，称米沙利为米煞，称亚撒利雅为亚伯尼歌。


但1:8
> But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine, and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself this way.
>
> 但以理却立志不以王的膳和王所饮的酒玷污自己，所以求太监长容他不玷污自己。


但1:9
> Now God had caused the official to show favor and sympathy to Daniel,
>
> 神使但以理在太监长眼前蒙恩惠，受怜悯。


但1:10
> but the official told Daniel, "I am afraid of my lord the king, who has assigned your food and drink. Why should he see you looking worse than the other young men your age? The king would then have my head because of you."
>
> 太监长对但以理说：“我惧怕我主我王，他已经派定你们的饮食，倘若他见你们的面貌比你们同岁的少年人肌瘦，怎么好呢？这样，你们就使我的头在王那里难保。”


但1:11
> Daniel then said to the guard whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah,
>
> 但以理对太监长所派管理但以理、哈拿尼雅、米沙利、亚撒利雅的委办说：


但1:12
> "Please test your servants for ten days: Give us nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink.
>
> “求你试试仆人们十天，给我们素菜吃，白水喝，


但1:13
> Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food, and treat your servants in accordance with what you see."
>
> 然后看看我们的面貌和用王膳那少年人的面貌，就照你所看的待仆人吧！”


但1:14
> So he agreed to this and tested them for ten days.
>
> 委办便允准他们这件事，试看他们十天。


但1:15
> At the end of the ten days they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food.
>
> 过了十天，见他们的面貌比用王膳的一切少年人更加俊美肥胖。


但1:16
> So the guard took away their choice food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables instead.
>
> 于是，委办撤去派他们用的膳、饮的酒，给他们素菜吃。


但1:17
> To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds.
>
> 这四个少年人，　神在各样文字学问上（“学问”原文作“智慧”）赐给他们聪明知识，但以理又明白各样的异象和梦兆。


但1:18
> At the end of the time set by the king to bring them in, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar.
>
> 尼布甲尼撒王预定带进少年人来的日期满了，太监长就把他们带到王面前。


但1:19
> The king talked with them, and he found none equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king's service.
>
> 王与他们谈论，见少年人中无一人能比但以理、哈拿尼雅、米沙利、亚撒利雅，所以留他们在王面前侍立。


但1:20
> In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom.
>
> 王考问他门一切事，就见他们的智慧聪明比通国的术士和用法术的胜过十倍。


但1:21
> And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.
>
> 到古列王元年，但以理还在。


## 但以理书第2章
但2:1
> In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his mind was troubled and he could not sleep.
>
> 尼布甲尼撒在位第二年，他做了梦，心里烦乱，不能睡觉。


但2:2
> So the king summoned the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers to tell him what he had dreamed. When they came in and stood before the king,
>
> 王吩咐人将术士、用法术的、行邪术的和迦勒底人召来，要他们将王的梦告诉王，他们就来站在王前。


但2:3
> he said to them, "I have had a dream that troubles me and I want to know what it means."
>
> 王对他们说：“我做了一梦，心里烦乱，要知道这是什么梦。”


但2:4
> Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic, "O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it."
>
> 迦勒底人用亚兰的言语对王说：“愿王万岁！请将那梦告诉仆人，仆人就可以讲解。”


但2:5
> The king replied to the astrologers, "This is what I have firmly decided: If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it, I will have you cut into pieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble.
>
> 王回答迦勒底人说，梦我已经忘了（或作我已定命八节同），你们若不将梦和梦的讲解告诉我，就必被凌迟，你们的房屋必成为粪堆。


但2:6
> But if you tell me the dream and explain it, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and interpret it for me."
>
> 你们若将梦和梦的讲解告诉我，就必从我这里得赠品和赏赐，并大尊荣。现在你们要将梦和梦的讲解告诉我。”


但2:7
> Once more they replied, "Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it."
>
> 他们第二次对王说：“请王将梦告诉仆人，仆人就可以讲解。”


但2:8
> Then the king answered, "I am certain that you are trying to gain time, because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided:
>
> 王回答说：“我准知道你们是故意迟延，因为你们知道那梦我已经忘了。


但2:9
> If you do not tell me the dream, there is just one penalty for you. You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the situation will change. So then, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can interpret it for me."
>
> 你们若不将梦告诉我，只有一法待你们，因为你们预备了谎言乱语向我说，要等候时势改变。现在你们要将梦告诉我，因我知道你们能将梦的讲解告诉我。”


但2:10
> The astrologers answered the king, "There is not a man on earth who can do what the king asks! No king, however great and mighty, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer.
>
> 迦勒底人在王面前回答说：“世上没有人能将王所问的事说出来；因为没有君王、大臣、掌权的向术士，或用法术的，或迦勒底人问过这样的事。


但2:11
> What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among men."
>
> 王所问的事甚难，除了不与世人同居的神明，没有人在王面前能说出来。”


但2:12
> This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon.
>
> 因此，王气忿忿地大发烈怒，吩咐灭绝巴比伦所有的哲士。


但2:13
> So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death.
>
> 于是命令发出，哲士将要见杀，人就寻找但以理和他的同伴，要杀他们。


但2:14
> When Arioch, the commander of the king's guard, had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact.
>
> 王的护卫长亚略出来，要杀巴比伦的哲士，但以理就用婉言回答他，


但2:15
> He asked the king's officer, "Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?" Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel.
>
> 向王的护卫长亚略说：“王的命令为何这样紧急呢？”亚略就将情节告诉但以理。


但2:16
> At this, Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him.
>
> 但以理遂进去求王宽限，就可以将梦的讲解告诉王。


但2:17
> Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.
>
> 但以理回到他的居所，将这事告诉他的同伴哈拿尼雅、米沙利、亚撒利雅，


但2:18
> He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
>
> 要他们祈求天上的　神施怜悯，将这奥秘的事指明，免得但以理和他的同伴与巴比伦其余的哲士一同灭亡。


但2:19
> During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven
>
> 这奥秘的事就在夜间异象中给但以理显明，但以理便称颂天上的　神。


但2:20
> and said: "Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever; wisdom and power are his.
>
> 但以理说：“　神的名是应当称颂的，从亘古直到永远！因为智慧能力都属乎他。


但2:21
> He changes times and seasons; he sets up kings and deposes them. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning.
>
> 他改变时候、日期、废王、立王，将智慧赐与智慧人，将知识赐与聪明人。


但2:22
> He reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with him.
>
> 他显明深奥隐秘的事，知道暗中所有的，光明也与他同居。


但2:23
> I thank and praise you, O God of my fathers: You have given me wisdom and power, you have made known to me what we asked of you, you have made known to us the dream of the king."
>
> 我列祖的　神啊，我感谢你、赞美你，因你将智慧才能赐给我，允准我们所求的，把王的事给我们指明。”


但2:24
> Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, "Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him."
>
> 于是，但以理进去见亚略，就是王所派灭绝巴比伦哲士的，对他说：“不要灭绝巴比伦的哲士，求你领我到王面前，我要将梦的讲解告诉王。”


但2:25
> Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said, "I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means."
>
> 亚略就急忙将但以理领到王面前，对王说：“我在被掳的犹大人中遇见一人，他能将梦的讲解告诉王。”


但2:26
> The king asked Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), "Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?"
>
> 王问称为伯提沙撒的但以理说：“你能将我所做的梦和梦的讲解告诉我吗？”


但2:27
> Daniel replied, "No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about,
>
> 但以理在王面前回答说：“王所问的那奥秘事，哲士、用法术的、术士、观兆的都不能告诉王，


但2:28
> but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you lay on your bed are these:
>
> 只有一位在天上的　神，能显明奥秘的事，他已将日后必有的事指示尼布甲尼撒王。你的梦和你在床上脑中的异象是这样：


但2:29
> "As you were lying there, O king, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen.
>
> 王啊，你在床上想到后来的事，那显明奥秘事的主把将来必有的事指示你。


但2:30
> As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than other living men, but so that you, O king, may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind.
>
> 至于那奥秘的事显明给我，并非因我的智慧胜过一切活人，乃为使王知道梦的讲解和心里的思念。


但2:31
> "You looked, O king, and there before you stood a large statue--an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance.
>
> 王啊，你梦见一个大像，这像甚高，极其光耀，站在你面前，形状甚是可怕。


但2:32
> The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze,
>
> 这像的头是精金的，胸膛和膀臂是银的，肚腹和腰是铜的，


但2:33
> its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay.
>
> 腿是铁的，脚是半铁半泥的。


但2:34
> While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them.
>
> 你观看，见有一块非人手凿出来的石头打在这像半铁半泥的脚上，把脚砸碎，


但2:35
> Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were broken to pieces at the same time and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth.
>
> 于是金、银、铜、铁、泥都一同砸得粉碎，成如夏天禾场上的糠秕，被风吹散，无处可寻。打碎这像的石头变成一座大山，充满天下。


但2:36
> "This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king.
>
> 这就是那梦，我们在王面前要讲解那梦。


但2:37
> You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory;
>
> 王啊，你是诸王之王，天上的　神已将国度、权柄、能力、尊荣都赐给你。


但2:38
> in your hands he has placed mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds of the air. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold.
>
> 凡世人所住之地的走兽，并天空的飞鸟，他都交付你手，使你掌管这一切。你就是那金头。


但2:39
> "After you, another kingdom will rise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth.
>
> 在你以后必另兴一国，不及于你。又有第三国，就是铜的，必掌管天下。


但2:40
> Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron--for iron breaks and smashes everything--and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others.
>
> 第四国，必坚壮如铁，铁能打碎克制百物，又能压碎一切，那国也必打碎压制列国。


但2:41
> Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay.
>
> 你既见像的脚和脚指头一半是窑匠的泥，一半是铁，那国将来也必分开。你既见铁与泥搀杂，那国也必有铁的力量。


但2:42
> As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle.
>
> 那脚指头既是半铁半泥，那国也必半强半弱。


但2:43
> And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay.
>
> 你既见铁与泥搀杂，那国民也必与各种人搀杂，却不能彼此相合，正如铁与泥不能相合一样。


但2:44
> "In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever.
>
> 当那列王在位的时候，天上的　神必另立一国，永不败坏，也不归别国的人，却要打碎灭绝那一切国，这国必存到永远。


但2:45
> This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands--a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces. "The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true and the interpretation is trustworthy."
>
> 你既看见非人手凿出来的一块石头从山而出，打碎金、银、铜、铁、泥，那就是至大的　神把后来必有的事给王指明。这梦准是这样，这讲解也是确实的。”


但2:46
> Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him.
>
> 当时，尼布甲尼撒王俯伏在地，向但以理下拜，并且吩咐人给他奉上供物和香品。


但2:47
> The king said to Daniel, "Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery."
>
> 王对但以理说：“你既能显明这奥秘的事，你们的　神诚然是万　神之神、万王之主，又是显明奥秘事的。”


但2:48
> Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men.
>
> 于是王高抬但以理，赏赐他许多上等礼物，派他管理巴比伦全省，又立他为总理，掌管巴比伦的一切哲士。


但2:49
> Moreover, at Daniel's request the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego administrators over the province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained at the royal court.
>
> 但以理求王，王就派沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌管理巴比伦省的事务，只是但以理常在朝中侍立。


## 但以理书第3章
但3:1
> King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, ninety feet high and nine feet wide, and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.
>
> 尼布甲尼撒王造了一个金像，高六十肘，宽六肘，立在巴比伦省杜拉平原。


但3:2
> He then summoned the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials to come to the dedication of the image he had set up.
>
> 尼布甲尼撒王差人将总督、钦差、巡抚、臬司、藩司、谋士、法官和各省的官员都召了来，为尼布甲尼撒王所立的像行开光之礼。


但3:3
> So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it.
>
> 于是总督、钦差、巡抚、臬司、藩司、谋士、法官和各省的官员都聚集了来，要为尼布甲尼撒王所立的像行开光之礼，就站在尼布甲尼撒所立的像前。


但3:4
> Then the herald loudly proclaimed, "This is what you are commanded to do, O peoples, nations and men of every language:
>
> 那时传令的大声呼叫说，各方，各国，各族的人哪（族原文作舌下同），有令传与你们，


但3:5
> As soon as you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.
>
> 你们一听见角、笛、琵琶、琴、瑟、笙和各样乐器的声音，就当俯伏敬拜尼布甲尼撒王所立的金像。


但3:6
> Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace."
>
> 凡不俯伏敬拜的，必立时扔在烈火的窑中。”


但3:7
> Therefore, as soon as they heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations and men of every language fell down and worshiped the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
>
> 因此各方、各国、各族的人民一听见角、笛、琵琶、琴、瑟和各样乐器的声音，就都俯伏敬拜尼布甲尼撒王所立的金像。


但3:8
> At this time some astrologers came forward and denounced the Jews.
>
> 那时，有几个迦勒底人进前来控告犹大人。


但3:9
> They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, "O king, live forever!
>
> 他们对尼布甲尼撒王说：“愿王万岁！


但3:10
> You have issued a decree, O king, that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the image of gold,
>
> 王啊，你曾降旨说，凡听见角、笛、琵琶、琴、瑟、笙和各样乐器声音的都当俯伏敬拜金像；


但3:11
> and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace.
>
> 凡不俯伏敬拜的，必扔在烈火的窑中。


但3:12
> But there are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon--Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego--who pay no attention to you, O king. They neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up."
>
> 现在有几个犹大人，就是王所派管理巴比伦省事务的沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌，王啊，这些人不理你，不事奉你的　神，也不敬拜你所立的金像。”


但3:13
> Furious with rage, Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king,
>
> 当时，尼布甲尼撒冲冲大怒，吩咐人把沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌带过来，他们就把那些人带到王面前。


但3:14
> and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, "Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the image of gold I have set up?
>
> 尼布甲尼撒问他们说：“沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌，你们不事奉我的　神，也不敬拜我所立的金像，是故意的吗？


但3:15
> Now when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music, if you are ready to fall down and worship the image I made, very good. But if you do not worship it, you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace. Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?"
>
> 你们再听见角、笛、琵琶、琴、瑟、笙和各样乐器的声音，若俯伏敬拜我所造的像，却还可以；若不敬拜，必立时扔在烈火的窑中！有何　神能救你们脱离我手呢？”


但3:16
> Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to the king, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter.
>
> 沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌对王说：“尼布甲尼撒啊，这件事我们不必回答你。


但3:17
> If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and he will rescue us from your hand, O king.
>
> 即便如此，我们所事奉的　神，能将我们从烈火的窑中救出来。王啊，他也必救我们脱离你的手；


但3:18
> But even if he does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up."
>
> 即或不然，王啊，你当知道我们决不事奉你的　神，也不敬拜你所立的金像！”


但3:19
> Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, and his attitude toward them changed. He ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual
>
> 当时，尼布甲尼撒怒气填胸，向沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌变了脸色，吩咐人把窑烧热，比寻常更加七倍。


但3:20
> and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace.
>
> 又吩咐他军中的几个壮士，将沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌捆起来，扔在烈火的窑中。


但3:21
> So these men, wearing their robes, trousers, turbans and other clothes, were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace.
>
> 这三人穿着裤子、内袍、外衣和别的衣服，被捆起来扔在烈火的窑中。


但3:22
> The king's command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego,
>
> 因为王命紧急，窑又甚热，那抬沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌的人都被火焰烧死。


但3:23
> and these three men, firmly tied, fell into the blazing furnace.
>
> 沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌这三个人都被捆着落在烈火的窑中。


但3:24
> Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisers, "Weren't there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?" They replied, "Certainly, O king."
>
> 那时，尼布甲尼撒王惊奇，急忙起来，对谋士说：“我捆起来扔在火里的不是三个人吗？”他们回答王说：“王啊，是。”


但3:25
> He said, "Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods."
>
> 王说：“看哪，我见有四个人，并没有捆绑，在火中游行，也没有受伤，那第四个的相貌好像　神子。”


但3:26
> Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, "Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!" So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire,
>
> 于是，尼布甲尼撒就近烈火窑门说：“至高　神的仆人沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌出来，上这里来吧！”沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌就从火中出来了。


但3:27
> and the satraps, prefects, governors and royal advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed; their robes were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them.
>
> 那些总督、钦差、巡抚和王的谋士，一同聚集看这三个人，见火无力伤他们的身体，头发也没有烧焦，衣裳也没有变色，并没有火燎的气味。


但3:28
> Then Nebuchadnezzar said, "Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent his angel and rescued his servants! They trusted in him and defied the king's command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.
>
> 尼布甲尼撒说：“沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌的　神是应当称颂的！他差遣使者救护倚靠他的仆人，他们不遵王命，舍去己身，在他们　神以外不肯事奉敬拜别　神。


但3:29
> Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble, for no other god can save in this way."
>
> 现在我降旨，无论何方、何国、何族的人，谤渎沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌之神的，必被凌迟，他的房屋必成粪堆，因为没有别　神能这样施行拯救。”


但3:30
> Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon.

> 那时，王在巴比伦省高升了沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌。

但4:5
> I had a dream that made me afraid. As I was lying in my bed, the images and visions that passed through my mind terrified me.

但4:7
> When the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners came, I told them the dream, but they could not interpret it for me.
>
> 于是那些术士、用法术的、迦勒底人、观兆的都进来，我将那梦告诉了他们，他们却不能把梦的讲解告诉我。


但4:8
> Finally, Daniel came into my presence and I told him the dream. (He is called Belteshazzar, after the name of my god, and the spirit of the holy gods is in him.)
>
> 末后，那照我　神的名，称为伯提沙撒的但以理来到我面前，他里头有圣　神的灵，我将梦告诉他说：


但4:9

>
> “术士的领袖伯提沙撒啊，因我知道你里头有圣　神的灵，什么奥秘的事都不能使你为难，现在要把我梦中所见的异象和梦的讲解告诉我。


但4:10
> These are the visions I saw while lying in my bed: I looked, and there before me stood a tree in the middle of the land. Its height was enormous.
>
> 我在床上脑中的异象是这样：我看见地当中有一棵树，极其高大。


但4:11
> The tree grew large and strong and its top touched the sky; it was visible to the ends of the earth.
>
> 那树渐长，而且坚固，高得顶天，从地极都能看见；


但4:12
> Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit abundant, and on it was food for all. Under it the beasts of the field found shelter, and the birds of the air lived in its branches; from it every creature was fed.

> 叶子华美，果子甚多，可作众生的食物；田野的走兽卧在荫下，天空的飞鸟宿在枝上；凡有血气的都从这树得食。


但4:13
> "In the visions I saw while lying in my bed, I looked, and there before me was a messenger, a holy one, coming down from heaven.
>
> 我在床上脑中的异象，见有一位守望的圣者从天而降，


但4:14
> He called in a loud voice: 'Cut down the tree and trim off its branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals flee from under it and the birds from its branches.
>
> 大声呼叫说：‘伐倒这树！砍下枝子，摇掉叶子，抛散果子，使走兽离开树下，飞鸟躲开树枝。


但4:15
> But let the stump and its roots, bound with iron and bronze, remain in the ground, in the grass of the field. "'Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth.

>
> 这是守望者所发的命，圣者所出的令，好叫世人知道至高者在人的国中掌权，要将国赐与谁，就赐与谁，或立极卑微的人执掌国权。’


但4:18
> "This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me what it means, for none of the wise men in my kingdom can interpret it for me. But you can, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you."
>
> 这是我尼布甲尼撒王所做的梦。伯提沙撒啊，你要说明这梦的讲解，因为我国中的一切哲士都不能将梦的讲解告诉我，惟独你能，因你里头有圣　神的灵。”


但4:19
> Then Daniel (also called Belteshazzar) was greatly perplexed for a time, and his thoughts terrified him. So the king said, "Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its meaning alarm you." Belteshazzar answered, "My lord, if only the dream applied to your enemies and its meaning to your adversaries!
>
> 于是称为伯提沙撒的但以理惊讶片时，心意惊惶。王说：“伯提沙撒啊，不要因梦和梦的讲解惊惶。”伯提沙撒回答说：“我主啊，愿这梦归与恨恶你的人，讲解归与你的敌人。


但4:20
> The tree you saw, which grew large and strong, with its top touching the sky, visible to the whole earth,
>
> 你所见的树渐长，而且坚固，高得顶天，从地极都能看见；


但4:21

> 叶子华美，果子甚多，可作众生的食物；田野的走兽住在其下；天空的飞鸟宿在枝上。


但4:22
> you, O king, are that tree! You have become great and strong; your greatness has grown until it reaches the sky, and your dominion extends to distant parts of the earth.
>
> 王啊，这渐长又坚固的树就是你。你的威势渐长及天，你的权柄管到地极。


但4:23
> "You, O king, saw a messenger, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, 'Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump, bound with iron and bronze, in the grass of the field, while its roots remain in the ground. Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven; let him live like the wild animals, until seven times pass by for him.'
>
> 王既看见一位守望的圣者从天而降，说：‘将这树砍伐毁坏，树墩却要留在地内，用铁圈和铜圈箍住，在田野的青草中让天露滴湿，使他与地上的兽一同吃草，直到经过七期。’


但4:24
> "This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree the Most High has issued against my lord the king:
>
> 王啊，讲解就是这样：临到我主我王的事是出于至高者的命。


但4:25
> You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like cattle and be drenched with the dew of heaven. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes.
>
> 你必被赶出离开世人，与野地的兽同居，吃草如牛，被天露滴湿，且要经过七期。等你知道至高者在人的国中掌权，要将国赐与谁就赐与谁。


但4:26
> The command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you when you acknowledge that Heaven rules.
>
> 守望者既吩咐存留树墩，等你知道诸天掌权，以后你的国必定归你。


但4:27
> Therefore, O king, be pleased to accept my advice: Renounce your sins by doing what is right, and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed. It may be that then your prosperity will continue."
>
> 王啊，求你悦纳我的谏言，以施行公义断绝罪过，以怜悯穷人除掉罪孽，或者你的平安可以延长。”


但4:28
> All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.
>
> 这事都临到尼布甲尼撒王。


但4:29
> Twelve months later, as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,
>
> 过了十二个月，他游行在巴比伦王宫里（原文作“上”）。


但4:30
> he said, "Is not this the great Babylon I have built as the royal residence, by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?"
>
> 他说：“这大巴比伦不是我用大能大力建为京都，要显我威严的荣耀吗？”


但4:31
> The words were still on his lips when a voice came from heaven, "This is what is decreed for you, King Nebuchadnezzar: Your royal authority has been taken from you.
>
> 这话在王口中尚未说完，有声音从天降下说：“尼布甲尼撒王啊，有话对你说：你的国位离开你了。


但4:32
> You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like cattle. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes."
>
> 你必被赶出离开世人，与野地的兽同居，吃草如牛，且要经过七期。等你知道至高者在人的国中掌权，要将国赐与谁，就赐与谁。”


但4:33
> Immediately what had been said about Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from people and ate grass like cattle. His body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird.
>
> 当时这话就应验在尼布甲尼撒的身上，他被赶出离开世人，吃草如牛，身被天露滴湿，头发长长，好像鹰毛，指甲长长，如同鸟爪。


但4:34
> At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was restored. Then I praised the Most High; I honored and glorified him who lives forever. His dominion is an eternal dominion; his kingdom endures from generation to generation.
>
> 日子满足，我尼布甲尼撒举目望天，我的聪明复归于我，我便称颂至高者，赞美尊敬活到永远的　神。他的权柄是永有的，他的国存到万代。


但4:35
> All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing. He does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth. No one can hold back his hand or say to him: "What have you done?"
>
> 世上所有的居民、都算为虚无。在天上的万军和世上的居民中，他都凭自己的意旨行事。无人能拦住他手，或问他说：“你做什么呢？”


但4:36
> At the same time that my sanity was restored, my honor and splendor were returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored to my throne and became even greater than before.
>
> 那时，我的聪明复归于我，为我国的荣耀威严和光耀也都复归于我，并且我的谋士和大臣也来朝见我。我又得坚立在国位上，至大的权柄加增于我。


但4:37
> Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, because everything he does is right and all his ways are just. And those who walk in pride he is able to humble.
>
> 现在我尼布甲尼撒赞美、尊崇、恭敬天上的王，因为他所做的全都诚实，他所行的也都公平。那行动骄傲的，他能降为卑。

> 伯沙撒王为他的一千大臣设摆盛筵，与这一千人对面饮酒。


但5:2

> 于是王的一切哲士都进来，却不能读那文字，也不能把讲解告诉王。


但5:9

> 伯沙撒王就甚惊惶。脸色改变，他的大臣也都惊奇。


但5:10
> The queen, hearing the voices of the king and his nobles, came into the banquet hall. "O king, live forever!" she said. "Don't be alarmed! Don't look so pale!

> 太后（或作“皇后”。下同）因王和他大臣所说的话，就进入宴宫说：“愿王万岁！你心意不要惊惶，脸面不要变色。


但5:11
> There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the time of your father he was found to have insight and intelligence and wisdom like that of the gods. King Nebuchadnezzar your father--your father the king, I say--appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners.
>
> 在你国中有一人，他里头有圣　神的灵。你父在世的日子，这人心中光明，又有聪明智慧，好像　神的智慧。你父尼布甲尼撒王，就是王的父，立他为术士、用法术的和迦勒底人并观兆的领袖。


但5:12

>
> 伯沙撒啊，你是他的儿子（或作“孙子”），你虽知道这一切，你心仍不自卑，


但5:23
> Instead, you have set yourself up against the Lord of heaven. You had the goblets from his temple brought to you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand. But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand your life and all your ways.
>
> 竟向天上的主自高，使人将他殿中的器皿拿到你面前，你和大臣、皇后、妃嫔用这器皿饮酒。你又赞美那不能看、不能听、无知无识、金、银、铜、铁、木、石所造的　神，却没有将荣耀归与那手中有你气息，管理你一切行动的　神。


但5:24
> Therefore he sent the hand that wrote the inscription.

> 因此，从　神那里显出指头来写这文字。


但5:25

但5:28
> Peres : Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians."

但6:1
> It pleased Darius to appoint 120 satraps to rule throughout the kingdom,
>
> 大利乌随心所愿，立一百二十个总督治理通国。


但6:2
> with three administrators over them, one of whom was Daniel. The satraps were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer loss.
>
> 又在他们以上立总长三人（但以理在其中），使总督在他们三人面前回覆事务，免得王受亏损。


但6:3
> Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.
>
> 因这但以理有美好的灵性，所以显然超乎其余的总长和总督，王又想立他治理通国。


但6:4
> At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent.
>
> 那时，总长和总督寻找但以理误国的把柄，为要参他；只是找不着他的错误过失，因他忠心办事，毫无错误过失。


但6:5
> Finally these men said, "We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God."
>
> 那些人便说：“我们要找参这但以理的把柄，除非在他　神的律法中就寻不着。”


但6:6
> So the administrators and the satraps went as a group to the king and said: "O King Darius, live forever!
>
> 于是，总长和总督纷纷聚集来见王说：“愿大利乌王万岁！


但6:7
> The royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers and governors have all agreed that the king should issue an edict and enforce the decree that anyone who prays to any god or man during the next thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be thrown into the lions' den.

> 国中的总长、钦差、总督、谋士和巡抚彼此商议，要立一条坚定的禁令（或作“求王下旨要立一条云云”），三十日内不拘何人，若在王以外，或向　神或向人求什么，就必扔在狮子坑中。


但6:8
> Now, O king, issue the decree and put it in writing so that it cannot be altered--in accordance with the laws of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed."
>
> 王啊，现在求你立这禁令，加盖玉玺，使禁令决不更改，照玛代和波斯人的例，是不可更改的。”


但6:9
> So King Darius put the decree in writing.
>
> 于是大利乌王立这禁令，加盖玉玺。


但6:10
> Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before.
>
> 但以理知道这禁令盖了玉玺，就到自己家里（他楼上的窗户开向耶路撒冷），一日三次双膝跪在他　神面前，祷告感谢，与素常一样。


但6:11
> Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help.
>
> 那些人就纷纷聚集，见但以理在他　神面前祈祷恳求，


但6:12
> So they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree: "Did you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or man except to you, O king, would be thrown into the lions' den?" The king answered, "The decree stands--in accordance with the laws of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed."
>
> 他们便进到王前，提王的禁令说：“王啊，三十日内不拘何人，若在王以外，或向　神或向人求什么，必被扔在狮子坑中，王不是在这禁令上盖了玉玺吗？”王回答说：“实有这事，照玛代和波斯人的例是不可更改的。”


但6:13
> Then they said to the king, "Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the decree you put in writing. He still prays three times a day."
>
> 他们对王说：“王啊，那被掳之犹大人中的但以理不理你，也不遵你盖了玉玺的禁令，他竟一日三次祈祷。”


但6:14
> When the king heard this, he was greatly distressed; he was determined to rescue Daniel and made every effort until sundown to save him.
>
> 王听见这话，就甚愁烦，一心要救但以理，筹划解救他，直到日落的时候。


但6:15
> Then the men went as a group to the king and said to him, "Remember, O king, that according to the law of the Medes and Persians no decree or edict that the king issues can be changed."
>
> 那些人就纷纷聚集来见王说：“王啊，当知道玛代人和波斯人有例，凡王所立的禁令和律例都不可更改。”


但6:16
> So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions' den. The king said to Daniel, "May your God, whom you serve continually, rescue you!"
>
> 王下令，人就把但以理带来，扔在狮子坑中。王对但以理说：“你所常事奉的　神，他必救你。”


但6:17
> A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles, so that Daniel's situation might not be changed.
>
> 有人搬石头放在坑口，王用自己的玺和大臣的印封闭那坑，使惩办但以理的事毫无更改。


但6:18
> Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night without eating and without any entertainment being brought to him. And he could not sleep.
>
> 王回宫，终夜禁食，无人拿乐器到他面前，并且睡不着觉。


但6:19
> At the first light of dawn, the king got up and hurried to the lions' den.
>
> 次日黎明，王就起来，急忙往狮子坑那里去。


但6:20
> When he came near the den, he called to Daniel in an anguished voice, "Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to rescue you from the lions?"
>
> 临近坑边，哀声呼叫但以理，对但以理说：“永生　神的仆人但以理啊！你所常事奉的　神能救你脱离狮子吗？”


但6:21
> Daniel answered, "O king, live forever!
>
> 但以理对王说：“愿王万岁！


但6:22
> My God sent his angel, and he shut the mouths of the lions. They have not hurt me, because I was found innocent in his sight. Nor have I ever done any wrong before you, O king."
>

>
> 它渐渐强大，高及天象，将些天象和星宿抛落在地，用脚践踏。

但8:14
> He said to me, "It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated."

>
> 他便来到我所站的地方。他一来，我就惊慌俯伏在地，他对我说：“人子啊，你要明白，因为这是关乎末后的异象。”

但8:24
> He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy the mighty men and the holy people.
>
> 他的权柄必大，却不是因自己的能力，他必行非常的毁灭。事情顺利，任意而行，又必毁灭有能力的和圣民。

>
> 所说二千三百日的异象是真的，但你要将这异象封住，因为关乎后来许多的日子。”


但8:27
