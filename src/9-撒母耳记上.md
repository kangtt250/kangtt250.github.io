# 撒母耳记上
## 撒母耳记上第1章
撒上1:1
> There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.
>
> 以法莲山地的拉玛琐非有一个以法莲人，名叫以利加拿，是苏弗的玄孙、托户的曾孙、以利户的孙子、耶罗罕的儿子。


撒上1:2
> He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.
>
> 他有两个妻：一名哈拿，一名毗尼拿。毗尼拿有儿女，哈拿没有儿女。


撒上1:3
> Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the LORD Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the LORD.
>
> 这人每年从本城上到示罗，敬拜祭祀万军之耶和华。在那里有以利的两个儿子何弗尼、非尼哈当耶和华的祭司。


撒上1:4
> Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.
>
> 以利加拿每逢献祭的日子，将祭肉分给他的妻毗尼拿和毗尼拿所生的儿女。


撒上1:5
> But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the LORD had closed her womb.
>
> 给哈拿的却是双份，因为他爱哈拿。无奈耶和华不使哈拿生育。


撒上1:6
> And because the LORD had closed her womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her.
>
> 毗尼拿见耶和华不使哈拿生育，就作她的对头，大大激动她，要使她生气。


撒上1:7
> This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat.
>
> 每年上到耶和华殿的时候，以利加拿都以双份给哈拿。毗尼拿仍是激动她，以致她哭泣不吃饭。


撒上1:8
> Elkanah her husband would say to her, "Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don't you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don't I mean more to you than ten sons?"
>
> 她丈夫以利加拿对她说：“哈拿啊，你为何哭泣不吃饭，心里愁闷呢？有我不比十个儿子还好吗？”


撒上1:9
> Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the LORD'S temple.
>
> 他们在示罗吃喝完了，哈拿就站起来。祭司以利在耶和华殿的门框旁边，坐在自己的位上。


撒上1:10
> In bitterness of soul Hannah wept much and prayed to the LORD.
>
> 哈拿心里愁苦，就痛痛哭泣，祈祷耶和华，


撒上1:11
> And she made a vow, saying, "O LORD Almighty, if you will only look upon your servant's misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the LORD for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head."
>
> 许愿说：“万军之耶和华啊，你若垂顾婢女的苦情，眷念不忘婢女，赐我一个儿子，我必使他终身归与耶和华，不用剃头刀剃他的头。”


撒上1:12
> As she kept on praying to the LORD, Eli observed her mouth.
>
> 哈拿在耶和华面前不住地祈祷，以利定睛看她的嘴。


撒上1:13
> Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk
>
> 原来哈拿心中默祷，只动嘴唇，不出声音，因此以利以为她喝醉了。


撒上1:14
> and said to her, "How long will you keep on getting drunk? Get rid of your wine."
>
> 以利对她说：“你要醉到几时呢？你不应该喝酒。”


撒上1:15
> "Not so, my lord," Hannah replied, "I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to the LORD.
>
> 哈拿回答说：“主啊，不是这样，我是心里愁苦的妇人，清酒浓酒都没有喝，但在耶和华面前倾心吐意。


撒上1:16
> Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief."
>
> 不要将婢女看作不正经的女子。我因被人激动，愁苦太多，所以祈求到如今。”


撒上1:17
> Eli answered, "Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him."
>
> 以利说：“你可以平平安安地回去，愿以色列的　神允准你向他所求的！”


撒上1:18
> She said, "May your servant find favor in your eyes." Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast.
>
> 哈拿说：“愿婢女在你眼前蒙恩。”于是妇人走去吃饭，面上再不带愁容了。


撒上1:19
> Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the LORD and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah lay with Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.
>
> 次日清早，他们起来，在耶和华面前敬拜，就回拉玛。到了家里，以利加拿和妻哈拿同房，耶和华顾念哈拿，


撒上1:20
> So in the course of time Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, saying, "Because I asked the LORD for him."
>
> 哈拿就怀孕。日期满足，生了一个儿子，给他起名叫撒母耳，说：“这是我从耶和华那里求来的。”


撒上1:21
> When the man Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the LORD and to fulfill his vow,
>
> 以利加拿和他全家都上示罗去，要向耶和华献年祭，并还所许的愿。


撒上1:22
> Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, "After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before the LORD, and he will live there always."
>
> 哈拿却没有上去，对丈夫说：“等孩子断了奶，我便带他上去朝见耶和华，使他永远住在那里。”


撒上1:23
> "Do what seems best to you," Elkanah her husband told her. "Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the LORD make good his word." So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him.
>
> 她丈夫以利加拿说：“就随你的意行吧！可以等儿子断了奶，但愿耶和华应验他的话。”于是妇人在家里乳养儿子，直到断了奶。


撒上1:24
> After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh.
>
> 既断了奶，就把孩子带上示罗，到了耶和华的殿，又带了三只公牛，一伊法细面，一皮袋酒。（那时孩子还小。）


撒上1:25
> When they had slaughtered the bull, they brought the boy to Eli,
>
> 宰了一只公牛，就领孩子到以利面前。


撒上1:26
> and she said to him, "As surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the LORD.
>
> 妇人说：“主啊，我敢在你面前起誓，从前在你这里站着祈求耶和华的那妇人，就是我。


撒上1:27
> I prayed for this child, and the LORD has granted me what I asked of him.
>
> 我祈求为要得这孩子，耶和华已将我所求的赐给我了。


撒上1:28
> So now I give him to the LORD. For his whole life he will be given over to the LORD." And he worshiped the LORD there.
>
> 所以我将这孩子归与耶和华，使他终身归与耶和华。”于是在那里敬拜耶和华。


## 撒母耳记上第2章
撒上2:1
> Then Hannah prayed and said: "My heart rejoices in the LORD; in the LORD my horn is lifted high. My mouth boasts over my enemies, for I delight in your deliverance.
>
> 哈拿祷告说：“我的心因耶和华快乐，我的角因耶和华高举。我的口向仇敌张开，我因耶和华的救恩欢欣。


撒上2:2
> "There is no one holy like the LORD; there is no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God.
>
> 只有耶和华为圣，除他以外没有可比的，也没有磐石像我们的　神。


撒上2:3
> "Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak such arrogance, for the LORD is a God who knows, and by him deeds are weighed.
>
> 人不要夸口说骄傲的话，也不要出狂妄的言语，因耶和华是大有知识的　神，人的行为被他衡量。


撒上2:4
> "The bows of the warriors are broken, but those who stumbled are armed with strength.
>
> 勇士的弓都已折断，跌倒的人以力量束腰。


撒上2:5
> Those who were full hire themselves out for food, but those who were hungry hunger no more. She who was barren has borne seven children, but she who has had many sons pines away.
>
> 素来饱足的，反作佣人求食；饥饿的，再不饥饿。不生育的，生了七个儿子；多有儿女的，反倒衰微。


撒上2:6
> "The LORD brings death and makes alive; he brings down to the grave and raises up.
>
> 耶和华使人死，也使人活；使人下阴间，也使人往上升。


撒上2:7
> The LORD sends poverty and wealth; he humbles and he exalts.
>
> 他使人贫穷，也使人富足；使人卑微，也使人高贵。


撒上2:8
> He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; he seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor. "For the foundations of the earth are the LORD'S; upon them he has set the world.
>
> 他从灰尘里抬举贫寒人，从粪堆中提拔穷乏人；使他们与王子同坐，得着荣耀的座位。地的柱子属于耶和华，他将世界立在其上。


撒上2:9
> He will guard the feet of his saints, but the wicked will be silenced in darkness. "It is not by strength that one prevails;
>
> 他必保护圣民的脚步；使恶人在黑暗中寂然不动。人都不能靠力量得胜。


撒上2:10
> those who oppose the LORD will be shattered. He will thunder against them from heaven; the LORD will judge the ends of the earth. "He will give strength to his king and exalt the horn of his anointed."
>
> 与耶和华争竞的，必被打碎；耶和华必从天上以雷攻击他，必审判地极的人；将力量赐与所立的王，高举受膏者的角。”


撒上2:11
> Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy ministered before the LORD under Eli the priest.
>
> 以利加拿往拉玛回家去了。那孩子在祭司以利面前事奉耶和华。


撒上2:12
> Eli's sons were wicked men; they had no regard for the LORD.
>
> 以利的两个儿子是恶人，不认识耶和华。


撒上2:13
> Now it was the practice of the priests with the people that whenever anyone offered a sacrifice and while the meat was being boiled, the servant of the priest would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand.
>
> 这二祭司待百姓是这样的规矩：凡有人献祭，正煮肉的时候，祭司的仆人就来，手拿三齿的叉子，


撒上2:14
> He would plunge it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot, and the priest would take for himself whatever the fork brought up. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh.
>
> 将叉子往罐里，或鼎里，或釜里，或锅里一插，插上来的肉，祭司都取了去。凡上到示罗的以色列人，他们都是这样看待。


撒上2:15
> But even before the fat was burned, the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, "Give the priest some meat to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, but only raw."
>
> 又在未烧脂油以前，祭司的仆人就来对献祭的人说：“将肉给祭司，叫他烤吧！他不要煮过的，要生的。”


撒上2:16
> If the man said to him, "Let the fat be burned up first, and then take whatever you want," the servant would then answer, "No, hand it over now; if you don't, I'll take it by force."
>
> 献祭的人若说：“必须先烧脂油，然后你可以随意取肉。”仆人就说：“你立时给我！不然我便抢去。”


撒上2:17
> This sin of the young men was very great in the LORD'S sight, for they were treating the LORD'S offering with contempt.
>
> 如此，这二少年人的罪在耶和华面前甚重了，因为他们藐视耶和华的祭物（或作“他们使人厌弃给耶和华献祭”）。


撒上2:18
> But Samuel was ministering before the LORD--a boy wearing a linen ephod.
>
> 那时，撒母耳还是孩子，穿着细麻布的以弗得，侍立在耶和华面前。


撒上2:19
> Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.
>
> 他母亲每年为他做一件小外袍，同着丈夫上来献年祭的时候带来给他。


撒上2:20
> Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, "May the LORD give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to the LORD." Then they would go home.
>
> 以利为以利加拿和他的妻祝福说：“愿耶和华由这妇人再赐你后裔，代替你从耶和华求来的孩子。”他们就回本乡去了。


撒上2:21
> And the LORD was gracious to Hannah; she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD.
>
> 耶和华眷顾哈拿，她就怀孕，生了三个儿子，两个女儿。那孩子撒母耳，在耶和华面前渐渐长大。


撒上2:22
> Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
>
> 以利年甚老迈，听见他两个儿子待以色列众人的事，又听见他们与会幕门前伺候的妇人苟合。


撒上2:23
> So he said to them, "Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours.
>
> 他就对他们说：“你们为何行这样的事呢？我从这众百姓听见你们的恶行。


撒上2:24
> No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear spreading among the LORD'S people.
>
> 我儿啊，不可这样！我听见你们的风声不好，你们使耶和华的百姓犯了罪。


撒上2:25
> If a man sins against another man, God may mediate for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who will intercede for him?" His sons, however, did not listen to their father's rebuke, for it was the LORD'S will to put them to death.
>
> 人若得罪人，有士师审判他；人若得罪耶和华，谁能为他祈求呢？”然而他们还是不听父亲的话，因为耶和华想要杀他们。


撒上2:26
> And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with men.
>
> 孩子撒母耳渐渐长大，耶和华与人越发喜爱他。


撒上2:27
> Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, "This is what the LORD says: 'Did I not clearly reveal myself to your father's house when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh?
>
> 有神人来见以利，对他说：“耶和华如此说：‘你祖父在埃及法老家作奴仆的时候，我不是向他们显现吗？


撒上2:28
> I chose your father out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your father's house all the offerings made with fire by the Israelites.
>
> 在以色列众支派中，我不是拣选人作我的祭司，使他烧香，在我坛上献祭，在我面前穿以弗得，又将以色列人所献的火祭都赐给你父家吗？


撒上2:29
> Why do you scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?'
>
> 我所吩咐献在我居所的祭物，你们为何践踏？尊重你的儿子过于尊重我，将我民以色列所献美好的祭物肥己呢？’


撒上2:30
> "Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: 'I promised that your house and your father's house would minister before me forever.' But now the LORD declares: 'Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained.
>
> 因此，耶和华以色列的　神说：‘我曾说，你和你父家必永远行在我面前；现在我却说，决不容你们这样行！因为尊重我的，我必重看他；藐视我的，他必被轻视。


撒上2:31
> The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in your family line
>
> 日子必到，我要折断你的膀臂和你父家的膀臂，使你家中没有一个老年人。


撒上2:32
> and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, in your family line there will never be an old man.
>
> 在　神使以色列人享福的时候，你必看见我居所的败落。在你家中必永远没有一个老年人。


撒上2:33
> Every one of you that I do not cut off from my altar will be spared only to blind your eyes with tears and to grieve your heart, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life.
>
> 我必不从我坛前灭尽你家中的人，那未灭的必使你眼目干瘪，心中忧伤。你家中所生的人都必死在中年。


撒上2:34
> "'And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you--they will both die on the same day.
>
> 你的两个儿子何弗尼、非尼哈所遭遇的事可作你的证据：他们二人必一日同死。


撒上2:35
> I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in my heart and mind. I will firmly establish his house, and he will minister before my anointed one always.
>
> 我要为自己立一个忠心的祭司，他必照我的心意而行。我要为他建立坚固的家，他必永远行在我的受膏者面前。


撒上2:36
> Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a crust of bread and plead, "Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat."'"
>
> 你家所剩下的人都必来叩拜他，求块银子，求个饼说：求你赐我祭司的职分，好叫我得点饼吃。’”


## 撒母耳记上第3章
撒上3:1
> The boy Samuel ministered before the LORD under Eli. In those days the word of the LORD was rare; there were not many visions.
>
> 童子撒母耳在以利面前事奉耶和华。当那些日子，耶和华的言语稀少，不常有默示。


撒上3:2
> One night Eli, whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see, was lying down in his usual place.
>
> 一日，以利睡卧在自己的地方。他眼目昏花，看不分明。


撒上3:3
> The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was.
>
> 神的灯在　神耶和华殿内约柜那里，还没有熄灭，撒母耳已经睡了。


撒上3:4
> Then the LORD called Samuel. Samuel answered, "Here I am."
>
> 耶和华呼唤撒母耳。撒母耳说：“我在这里！”


撒上3:5
> And he ran to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." But Eli said, "I did not call; go back and lie down." So he went and lay down.
>
> 就跑到以利那里说：“你呼唤我，我在这里。”以利回答说：“我没有呼唤你，你去睡吧！”他就去睡了。


撒上3:6
> Again the LORD called, "Samuel!" And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." "My son," Eli said, "I did not call; go back and lie down."
>
> 耶和华又呼唤撒母耳。撒母耳起来，到以利那里说：“你呼唤我，我在这里。”以利回答说：“我的儿，我没有呼唤你，你去睡吧！”


撒上3:7
> Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD: The word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.
>
> 那时，撒母耳还未认识耶和华，也未得耶和华的默示。


撒上3:8
> The LORD called Samuel a third time, and Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." Then Eli realized that the LORD was calling the boy.
>
> 耶和华第三次呼唤撒母耳。撒母耳起来，到以利那里说：“你又呼唤我，我在这里。”以利才明白是耶和华呼唤童子。


撒上3:9
> So Eli told Samuel, "Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, 'Speak, LORD, for your servant is listening.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
>
> 因此，以利对撒母耳说：“你仍去睡吧！若再呼唤你，你就说：‘耶和华啊，请说，仆人敬听！’”撒母耳就去仍睡在原处。


撒上3:10
> The LORD came and stood there, calling as at the other times, "Samuel! Samuel!" Then Samuel said, "Speak, for your servant is listening."
>
> 耶和华又来站着，像前三次呼唤说：“撒母耳啊！撒母耳啊！”撒母耳回答说：“请说，仆人敬听！”


撒上3:11
> And the LORD said to Samuel: "See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle.
>
> 耶和华对撒母耳说：“我在以色列中必行一件事，叫听见的人都必耳鸣。


撒上3:12
> At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his family--from beginning to end.
>
> 我指着以利家所说的话，到了时候，我必始终应验在以利身上。


撒上3:13
> For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons made themselves contemptible, and he failed to restrain them.
>
> 我曾告诉他必永远降罚与他的家，因他知道儿子作孽，自招咒诅，却不禁止他们。


撒上3:14
> Therefore, I swore to the house of Eli, 'The guilt of Eli's house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.'"
>
> 所以我向以利家起誓说：‘以利家的罪孽，虽献祭奉礼物，永不能得赎去。’”


撒上3:15
> Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the LORD. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision,
>
> 撒母耳睡到天亮，就开了耶和华的殿门，不敢将默示告诉以利。


撒上3:16
> but Eli called him and said, "Samuel, my son." Samuel answered, "Here I am."
>
> 以利呼唤撒母耳说：“我儿撒母耳啊！”撒母耳回答说：“我在这里！”


撒上3:17
> "What was it he said to you?" Eli asked. "Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you."
>
> 以利说：“耶和华对你说什么，你不要向我隐瞒；你若将　神对你所说的隐瞒一句，愿他重重地降罚与你。”


撒上3:18
> So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said, "He is the LORD; let him do what is good in his eyes."
>
> 撒母耳就把一切话都告诉了以利，并没有隐瞒。以利说：“这是出于耶和华，愿他凭自己的意旨而行。”


撒上3:19
> The LORD was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of his words fall to the ground.
>
> 撒母耳长大了，耶和华与他同在，使他所说的话，一句都不落空。

> 从但到别是巴所有的以色列人，都知道耶和华立撒母耳为先知。


撒上3:21
> The LORD continued to appear at Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word.
>
> 耶和华又在示罗显现，因为耶和华将自己的话默示撒母耳，撒母耳就把这话传遍以色列地。


## 撒母耳记上第4章
撒上4:1
> And Samuel's word came to all Israel. Now the Israelites went out to fight against the Philistines. The Israelites camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines at Aphek.
>
> 以色列人出去与非利士人打仗，安营在以便以谢；非利士人安营在亚弗。


撒上4:2
> The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield.
>
> 非利士人向以色列人摆阵。两军交战的时候，以色列人败在非利士人面前。非利士人在战场上杀了他们的军兵约有四千人。


撒上4:3
> When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, "Why did the LORD bring defeat upon us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the LORD'S covenant from Shiloh, so that it may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies."
>
> 百姓回到营里，以色列的长老说：“耶和华今日为何使我们败在非利士人面前呢？我们不如将耶和华的约柜，从示罗抬到我们这里来，好在我们中间救我们脱离敌人的手。”


撒上4:4
> So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the LORD Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim. And Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
>
> 于是，百姓打发人到示罗，从那里将坐在二基路伯上万军之耶和华的约柜抬来。以利的两个儿子何弗尼、非尼哈与　神的约柜同来。


撒上4:5
> When the ark of the LORD'S covenant came into the camp, all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook.
>
> 耶和华的约柜到了营中，以色列众人就大声欢呼，地便震动。


撒上4:6
> Hearing the uproar, the Philistines asked, "What's all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?" When they learned that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp,
>
> 非利士人听见欢呼的声音，就说：“在希伯来人营里大声欢呼，是什么缘故呢？”随后就知道耶和华的约柜到了营中。


撒上4:7
> the Philistines were afraid. "A god has come into the camp," they said. "We're in trouble! Nothing like this has happened before.
>
> 非利士人就惧怕起来说：“有　神到了他们营中。”又说：“我们有祸了！向来不曾有这样的事。


撒上4:8
> Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? They are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the desert.
>
> 我们有祸了！谁能救我们脱离这些大能之神的手呢？从前在旷野用各样灾殃击打埃及人的，就是这些　神。


撒上4:9
> Be strong, Philistines! Be men, or you will be subject to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Be men, and fight!"
>
> 非利士人哪，你们要刚强，要作大丈夫，免得作希伯来人的奴仆，如同他们作你们的奴仆一样。你们要作大丈夫，与他们争战。”


撒上4:10
> So the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were defeated and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great; Israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers.
>
> 非利士人和以色列人打仗，以色列人败了，各向各家奔逃。被杀的人甚多，以色列的步兵仆倒了三万。


撒上4:11
> The ark of God was captured, and Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
>
> 神的约柜被掳去，以利的两个儿子何弗尼、非尼哈也都被杀了。

>
> 当日，有一个便雅悯人从阵上逃跑，衣服撕裂，头蒙灰尘，来到示罗。


撒上4:13

> I thought, 'Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the LORD'S favor.' So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering."
>
> 所以我心里说：恐怕我没有祷告耶和华，非利士人下到吉甲攻击我，我就勉强献上燔祭。”


撒上13:13
> "You acted foolishly," Samuel said. "You have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time.
>
> 撒母耳对扫罗说：“你做了糊涂事了！没有遵守耶和华你　神所吩咐你的命令。若遵守，耶和华必在以色列中坚立你的王位，直到永远。


撒上13:14
> But now your kingdom will not endure; the LORD has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him leader of his people, because you have not kept the LORD'S command."
>
> 现在你的王位必不长久。耶和华已经寻着一个合他心意的人，立他作百姓的君，因为你没有遵守耶和华所吩咐你的。”


撒上13:15
> Then Samuel left Gilgal and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin, and Saul counted the men who were with him. They numbered about six hundred.
>
> 撒母耳就起来，从吉甲上到便雅悯的基比亚。扫罗数点跟随他的，约有六百人。


撒上13:16
> Saul and his son Jonathan and the men with them were staying in Gibeah in Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Micmash.
>
> 扫罗和他儿子约拿单并跟随他们的人，都住在便雅悯的迦巴，但非利士人安营在密抹。


撒上13:17
> Raiding parties went out from the Philistine camp in three detachments. One turned toward Ophrah in the vicinity of Shual,
>
> 有掠兵从非利士营中出来，分为三队：一队往俄弗拉向书亚地去，


撒上13:18
> another toward Beth Horon, and the third toward the borderland overlooking the Valley of Zeboim facing the desert.
>
> 一队往伯和仑去，一队往洗波音谷对面的地境向旷野去。


撒上13:19
> Not a blacksmith could be found in the whole land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, "Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!"
>
> 那时，以色列全地没有一个铁匠，因为非利士人说：“恐怕希伯来人制造刀枪。”


撒上13:20
> So all Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plowshares, mattocks, axes and sickles sharpened.
>
> 以色列人要磨锄、犁、斧、铲，就下到非利士人那里去磨。


撒上13:21
> The price was two thirds of a shekel for sharpening plowshares and mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening forks and axes and for repointing goads.
>
> 但有锉可以锉铲、犁、三齿叉、斧子并赶牛锥。


撒上13:22
> So on the day of the battle not a soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear in his hand; only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.
>
> 所以到了争战的日子，跟随扫罗和约拿单的人，没有一个手里有刀有枪的，惟独扫罗和他儿子约拿单有。


撒上13:23
> Now a detachment of Philistines had gone out to the pass at Micmash.
>
> 非利士人的一队防兵到了密抹的隘口。


## 撒母耳记上第14章
撒上14:1
> One day Jonathan son of Saul said to the young man bearing his armor, "Come, let's go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side." But he did not tell his father.
>
> 有一日，扫罗的儿子约拿单对拿他兵器的少年人说：“我们不如过到那边，到非利士人的防营那里去。”但他没有告诉父亲。

> Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron. With him were about six hundred men,
>
> 扫罗在基比亚的尽边，坐在米矶仑的石榴树下，跟随他的约有六百人。


撒上14:3
> among whom was Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod. He was a son of Ichabod's brother Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD'S priest in Shiloh. No one was aware that Jonathan had left.
>
> 在那里有亚希突的儿子亚希亚，穿着以弗得。（亚希突是以迦博的哥哥，非尼哈的儿子，以利的孙子。以利从前在示罗作耶和华的祭司。）约拿单去了，百姓却不知道。


撒上14:4
> On each side of the pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost was a cliff; one was called Bozez, and the other Seneh.
>
> 约拿单要从隘口过到非利士防营那里去。这隘口两边各有一个山峰：一名播薛，一名西尼；


撒上14:5
> One cliff stood to the north toward Micmash, the other to the south toward Geba.
>
> 一峰向北，与密抹相对，一峰向南，与迦巴相对。


撒上14:6
> Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer, "Come, let's go over to the outpost of those uncircumcised fellows. Perhaps the LORD will act in our behalf. Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few."
>
> 约拿单对拿兵器的少年人说：“我们不如过到未受割礼人的防营那里去，或者耶和华为我们施展能力，因为耶和华使人得胜，不在乎人多人少。”


撒上14:7
> "Do all that you have in mind," his armor-bearer said. "Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul."
>
> 拿兵器的对他说：“随你的心意行吧！你可以上去，我必跟随你，与你同心。”


撒上14:8
> Jonathan said, "Come, then; we will cross over toward the men and let them see us.
>
> 约拿单说：“我们要过到那些人那里去，使他们看见我们。


撒上14:9
> If they say to us, 'Wait there until we come to you,' we will stay where we are and not go up to them.
>
> 他们若对我们说：‘你们站住，等我们到你们那里去’，我们就站住，不上他们那里去。


撒上14:10
> But if they say, 'Come up to us,' we will climb up, because that will be our sign that the LORD has given them into our hands."
>
> 他们若说：‘你们上到我们这里来’，这话就是我们的证据，我们便上去，因为耶和华将他们交在我们手里了。”


撒上14:11
> So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. "Look!" said the Philistines. "The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in."
>
> 二人就使非利士的防兵看见。非利士人说：“希伯来人从所藏的洞穴里出来了。”


撒上14:12
> The men of the outpost shouted to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, "Come up to us and we'll teach you a lesson." So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, "Climb up after me; the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel."
>
> 防兵对约拿单和拿兵器的人说：“你们上到这里来，我们有一件事指示你们。”约拿单就对拿兵器的人说：“你跟随我上去，因为耶和华将他们交在以色列人手里了。”


撒上14:13
> Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and killed behind him.
>
> 约拿单就爬上去，拿兵器的人跟随他。约拿单杀倒非利士人，拿兵器的人也随着杀他们。


撒上14:14
> In that first attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed some twenty men in an area of about half an acre.
>
> 约拿单和拿兵器的人起头所杀的，约有二十人，都在一亩地的半犁沟之内。


撒上14:15
> Then panic struck the whole army--those in the camp and field, and those in the outposts and raiding parties--and the ground shook. It was a panic sent by God.
>
> 于是在营中、在田野、在众民内，都有战兢，防兵和掠兵也都战兢，地也震动，战兢之势甚大。


撒上14:16
> Saul's lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions.
>
> 在便雅悯的基比亚，扫罗的守望兵看见非利士的军众溃散，四围乱窜。


撒上14:17
> Then Saul said to the men who were with him, "Muster the forces and see who has left us." When they did, it was Jonathan and his armor-bearer who were not there.
>
> 扫罗就对跟随他的民说：“你们查点查点，看从我们这里出去的是谁？”他们一查点，就知道约拿单和拿兵器的人没有在这里。


撒上14:18
> Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring the ark of God." (At that time it was with the Israelites.)
>
> 那时　神的约柜在以色列人那里。扫罗对亚希亚说：“你将　神的约柜运了来。”


撒上14:19
> While Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the Philistine camp increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand."
>
> 扫罗正与祭司说话的时候，非利士营中的喧嚷越发大了。扫罗就对祭司说：“停手吧!”


撒上14:20
> Then Saul and all his men assembled and went to the battle. They found the Philistines in total confusion, striking each other with their swords.
>
> 扫罗和跟随他的人都聚集，来到战场，看见非利士人用刀互相击杀，大大惶乱。


撒上14:21
> Those Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone up with them to their camp went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
>
> 从前由四方来跟随非利士军的希伯来人，现在也转过来帮助跟随扫罗和约拿单的以色列人了。


撒上14:22
> When all the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were on the run, they joined the battle in hot pursuit.
>
> 那藏在以法莲山地的以色列人，听说非利士人逃跑，就出来紧紧地追杀他们。


撒上14:23
> So the LORD rescued Israel that day, and the battle moved on beyond Beth Aven.
>
> 那日，耶和华使以色列人得胜，一直战到伯亚文。


撒上14:24
> Now the men of Israel were in distress that day, because Saul had bound the people under an oath, saying, "Cursed be any man who eats food before evening comes, before I have avenged myself on my enemies!" So none of the troops tasted food.
>
> 扫罗叫百姓起誓说：“凡不等到晚上向敌人报完了仇吃什么的，必受咒诅。”因此这日百姓没有吃什么，就极其困惫。


撒上14:25
> The entire army entered the woods, and there was honey on the ground.
>
> 众民进入树林，见有蜜在地上。


撒上14:26
> When they went into the woods, they saw the honey oozing out, yet no one put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath.
>
> 他们进了树林，见有蜜流下来，却没有人敢用手取蜜入口，因为他们怕那誓言。


撒上14:27
> But Jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath, so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb. He raised his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened.
>
> 约拿单没有听见他父亲叫百姓起誓，所以伸手中的杖，用杖头蘸在蜂房里，转手送入口内，眼睛就明亮了。


撒上14:28
> Then one of the soldiers told him, "Your father bound the army under a strict oath, saying, 'Cursed be any man who eats food today!' That is why the men are faint."
>
> 百姓中有一人对他说：“你父亲曾叫百姓严严地起誓说，今日吃什么的，必受咒诅。因此百姓就疲乏了。”


撒上14:29
> Jonathan said, "My father has made trouble for the country. See how my eyes brightened when I tasted a little of this honey.
>
> 约拿单说：“我父亲连累你们了。你看，我尝了这一点蜜，眼睛就明亮了。


撒上14:30
> How much better it would have been if the men had eaten today some of the plunder they took from their enemies. Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?"
>
> 今日百姓若任意吃了从仇敌所夺的物，击杀的非利士人岂不更多吗？”


撒上14:31
> That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Micmash to Aijalon, they were exhausted.
>
> 这日，以色列人击杀非利士人，从密抹直到亚雅仑。百姓甚是疲乏，


撒上14:32
> They pounced on the plunder and, taking sheep, cattle and calves, they butchered them on the ground and ate them, together with the blood.
>
> 就急忙将所夺的牛羊和牛犊宰于地上，肉还带血就吃了。


撒上14:33
> Then someone said to Saul, "Look, the men are sinning against the LORD by eating meat that has blood in it." "You have broken faith," he said. "Roll a large stone over here at once."
>
> 有人告诉扫罗说：“百姓吃带血的肉，得罪耶和华了。”扫罗说：“你们有罪了，今日要将大石头滚到我这里来。”


撒上14:34
> Then he said, "Go out among the men and tell them, 'Each of you bring me your cattle and sheep, and slaughter them here and eat them. Do not sin against the LORD by eating meat with blood still in it.'" So everyone brought his ox that night and slaughtered it there.
>
> 扫罗又说：“你们散在百姓中，对他们说：‘你们各人将牛羊牵到我这里来宰了吃，不可吃带血的肉得罪耶和华。’”这夜，百姓就把牛羊牵到那里宰了。


撒上14:35
> Then Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first time he had done this.
>
> 扫罗为耶和华筑了一座坛，这是他初次为耶和华筑的坛。


撒上14:36
> Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them till dawn, and let us not leave one of them alive." "Do whatever seems best to you," they replied. But the priest said, "Let us inquire of God here."
>
> 扫罗说：“我们不如夜里下去追赶非利士人，抢掠他们，直到天亮，不留他们一人。”众民说：“你看怎样好就去行吧!”祭司说：“我们先当亲近　神。”


撒上14:37
> So Saul asked God, "Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into Israel's hand?" But God did not answer him that day.
>
> 扫罗求问　神说：“我下去追赶非利士人可以不可以？你将他们交在以色列人手里不交？”这日　神没有回答他。


撒上14:38
> Saul therefore said, "Come here, all you who are leaders of the army, and let us find out what sin has been committed today.
>
> 扫罗说：“你们百姓中的长老都上这里来，查明今日是谁犯了罪。


撒上14:39
> As surely as the LORD who rescues Israel lives, even if it lies with my son Jonathan, he must die." But not one of the men said a word.
>
> 我指着救以色列永生的耶和华起誓，就是我儿子约拿单犯了罪，他也必死。”但百姓中无一人回答他。


撒上14:40
> Saul then said to all the Israelites, "You stand over there; I and Jonathan my son will stand over here." "Do what seems best to you," the men replied.
>
> 扫罗就对以色列众人说：“你们站在一边，我与我儿子约拿单也站在一边。”百姓对扫罗说：“你看怎样好就去行吧!”


撒上14:41
> Then Saul prayed to the LORD, the God of Israel, "Give me the right answer." And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, and the men were cleared.
>
> 扫罗祷告耶和华以色列的　神说：“求你指示实情。”于是掣签掣出扫罗和约拿单来，百姓尽都无事。


撒上14:42
> Saul said, "Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son." And Jonathan was taken.
>
> 扫罗说：“你们再掣签，看是我、是我儿子约拿单。”就掣出约拿单来。


撒上14:43
> Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done." So Jonathan told him, "I merely tasted a little honey with the end of my staff. And now must I die?"
>
> 扫罗对约拿单说：“你告诉我，你做了什么事？”约拿单说：“我实在以手里的杖，用杖头蘸了一点蜜尝了一尝。这样我就死吗（“吗”或作“吧”）？”


撒上14:44
> Saul said, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you do not die, Jonathan."
>
> 扫罗说：“约拿单哪，你定要死!若不然，愿　神重重地降罚与我。”


撒上14:45
> But the men said to Saul, "Should Jonathan die--he who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel? Never! As surely as the LORD lives, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he did this today with God's help." So the men rescued Jonathan, and he was not put to death.
>
> 百姓对扫罗说：“约拿单在以色列人中这样大行拯救，岂可使他死呢？断乎不可！我们指着永生的耶和华起誓，连他的一根头发也不可落地，因为他今日与　神一同做事。”于是，百姓救约拿单免了死亡。


撒上14:46
> Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they withdrew to their own land.
>
> 扫罗回去，不追赶非利士人，非利士人也回本地去了。


撒上14:47
> After Saul had assumed rule over Israel, he fought against their enemies on every side: Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment on them.
>
> 扫罗执掌以色列的国权，常常攻击他四围的一切仇敌，就是摩押人、亚扪人、以东人和琐巴诸王，并非利士人。他无论往何处去，都打败仇敌。


撒上14:48
> He fought valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of those who had plundered them.
>
> 扫罗奋勇攻击亚玛力人，救了以色列人脱离抢掠他们之人的手。

撒上15:1
> Sauel said to Saul, "I am the one the LORD sent to anoint you king over his people Israel; so listen now to the message from the LORD.
>
> 撒母耳对扫罗说：“耶和华差遣我膏你为王，治理他的百姓以色列，所以你当听从耶和华的话。


撒上15:2
> This is what the LORD Almighty says: 'I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt.

> 万军之耶和华如此说：‘以色列人出埃及的时候，在路上亚玛力人怎样待他们，怎样抵挡他们，我都没忘。


撒上15:3
> Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy everything that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.'"
>
> 现在你要去击打亚玛力人，灭尽他们所有的，不可怜惜他们，将男女、孩童、吃奶的，并牛、羊、骆驼和驴尽行杀死。’”


撒上15:4
> So Saul summoned the men and mustered them at Telaim--two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men from Judah.
>
> 于是，扫罗招聚百姓在提拉因，数点他们，共有步兵二十万，另有犹大人一万。


撒上15:5
> Saul went to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the ravine.

撒上15:6
> Then he said to the Kenites, "Go away, leave the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you along with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt." So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.
>
> 扫罗对基尼人说：“你们离开亚玛力人下去吧！恐怕我将你们和亚玛力人一同杀灭。因为以色列人出埃及的时候，你们曾恩待他们。”于是，基尼人离开亚玛力人去了。


撒上15:7
> Then Saul attacked the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, to the east of Egypt.
>
> 扫罗击打亚玛力人，从哈腓拉直到埃及前的书珥，


撒上15:8
> He took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and all his people he totally destroyed with the sword.
>
> 生擒了亚玛力王亚甲，用刀杀尽亚玛力的众民。


撒上15:9
> But Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves and lambs--everything that was good. These they were unwilling to destroy completely, but everything that was despised and weak they totally destroyed.
>
> 扫罗和百姓却怜惜亚甲，也爱惜上好的牛、羊、牛犊、羊羔并一切美物，不肯灭绝；凡下贱瘦弱的，尽都杀了。


撒上15:10
> Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel:
>
> 耶和华的话临到撒母耳说：


撒上15:11
> "I am grieved that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions." Samuel was troubled, and he cried out to the LORD all that night.
>
> “我立扫罗为王，我后悔了，因为他转去不跟从我，不遵守我的命令。”撒母耳便甚忧愁，终夜哀求耶和华。


撒上15:12
> Early in the morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul, but he was told, "Saul has gone to Carmel. There he has set up a monument in his own honor and has turned and gone on down to Gilgal."
>
> 撒母耳清早起来，迎接扫罗。有人告诉撒母耳说：“扫罗到了迦密，在那里立了纪念碑，又转身下到吉甲。”


撒上15:13
> When Samuel reached him, Saul said, "The LORD bless you! I have carried out the LORD'S instructions."
>
> 撒母耳到了扫罗那里，扫罗对他说：“愿耶和华赐福与你，耶和华的命令我已遵守了。”


撒上15:14
> But Samuel said, "What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears? What is this lowing of cattle that I hear?"
>
> 撒母耳说：“我耳中听见有羊叫牛鸣，是从哪里来的呢？”


撒上15:15
> Saul answered, "The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the LORD your God, but we totally destroyed the rest."
>
> 扫罗说：“这是百姓从亚玛力人那里带来的，因为他们爱惜上好的牛羊，要献与耶和华你的　神。其余的，我们都灭尽了。”


撒上15:16
> "Stop!" Samuel said to Saul. "Let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night." "Tell me," Saul replied.
>
> 撒母耳对扫罗说：“你住口吧!等我将耶和华昨夜向我所说的话告诉你。”扫罗说：“请讲。”


撒上15:17
> Samuel said, "Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel.
>
> 撒母耳对扫罗说：“从前你虽然以自己为小，岂不是被立为以色列支派的元首吗？耶和华膏你作以色列的王。


撒上15:18
> And he sent you on a mission, saying, 'Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; make war on them until you have wiped them out.'
>
> 耶和华差遣你，吩咐你说：‘你去击打那些犯罪的亚玛力人，将他们灭绝净尽。’


撒上15:19
> Why did you not obey the LORD? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the LORD?"
>
> 你为何没有听从耶和华的命令，急忙掳掠财物，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事呢？”


撒上15:20
> "But I did obey the LORD," Saul said. "I went on the mission the LORD assigned me. I completely destroyed the Amalekites and brought back Agag their king.
>
> 扫罗对撒母耳说：“我实在听从了耶和华的命令，行了耶和华所差遣我行的路，擒了亚玛力王亚甲来，灭尽了亚玛力人。


撒上15:21
> The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of what was devoted to God, in order to sacrifice them to the LORD your God at Gilgal."
>
> 百姓却在所当灭的物中取了最好的牛羊，要在吉甲献与耶和华你的　神。”


撒上15:22
> But Samuel replied: "Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the LORD? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams.
>
> 撒母耳说：“耶和华喜悦燔祭和平安祭，岂如喜悦人听从他的话呢？听命胜于献祭；顺从胜于公羊的脂油。


撒上15:23
> For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has rejected you as king."
>
> 悖逆的罪与行邪术的罪相等；顽梗的罪与拜虚　神和偶像的罪相同。你既厌弃耶和华的命令，耶和华也厌弃你作王。”


撒上15:24
> Then Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned. I violated the LORD'S command and your instructions. I was afraid of the people and so I gave in to them.
>
> 扫罗对撒母耳说：“我有罪了！我因惧怕百姓，听从他们的话，就违背了耶和华的命令和你的言语。


撒上15:25
> Now I beg you, forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD."
>
> 现在求你赦免我的罪，同我回去，我好敬拜耶和华。”


撒上15:26
> But Samuel said to him, "I will not go back with you. You have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you as king over Israel!"
>
> 撒母耳对扫罗说：“我不同你回去，因为你厌弃耶和华的命令，耶和华也厌弃你作以色列的王。”


撒上15:27
> As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore.
>
> 撒母耳转身要走，扫罗就扯住他外袍的衣襟，衣襟就撕断了。


撒上15:28
> Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors--to one better than you.
>
> 撒母耳对他说：“如此，今日耶和华使以色列国与你断绝，将这国赐与比你更好的人。


撒上15:29
> He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a man, that he should change his mind."
>
> 以色列的大能者必不至说谎，也不至后悔。因为他迥非世人，决不后悔。”


撒上15:30
> Saul replied, "I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel; come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD your God."
>
> 扫罗说：“我有罪了，虽然如此，求你在我百姓的长老和以色列人面前抬举我，同我回去，我好敬拜耶和华你的　神。”


撒上15:31
> So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD.
>
> 于是，撒母耳转身跟随扫罗回去，扫罗就敬拜耶和华。


撒上15:32
> Then Samuel said, "Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites." Agag came to him confidently, thinking, "Surely the bitterness of death is past."

撒上18:17
> Saul said to David, "Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you in marriage; only serve me bravely and fight the battles of the LORD." For Saul said to himself, "I will not raise a hand against him. Let the Philistines do that!"
>
> 扫罗对大卫说：“我将大女儿米拉给你为妻，只要你为我奋勇，为耶和华争战。”扫罗心里说：“我不好亲手害他，要借非利士人的手害他。”


撒上18:18
> But David said to Saul, "Who am I, and what is my family or my father's clan in Israel, that I should become the king's son-in-law?"
>
> 大卫对扫罗说：“我是谁，我是什么出身，我父家在以色列中是何等的家，岂敢作王的女婿呢？”


撒上18:19
> So when the time came for Merab, Saul's daughter, to be given to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah.

>
> 扫罗的次女米甲爱大卫。有人告诉扫罗，扫罗就喜悦。


撒上18:21
> "I will give her to him," he thought, "so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him." So Saul said to David, "Now you have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law."
>
> 扫罗心里说：“我将这女儿给大卫，作他的网罗，好借非利士人的手害他。”所以扫罗对大卫说：“你今日可以第二次作我的女婿。”

>
> 扫罗的臣仆就照这话说给大卫听。大卫说：“你们以为作王的女婿是一件小事吗？我是贫穷卑微的人。”


撒上18:24
> When Saul's servants told him what David had said,
>
> 扫罗的臣仆回奏说，大卫所说的如此如此。


撒上18:25
> Saul replied, "Say to David, 'The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.'" Saul's plan was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines.
>
> 扫罗说：“你们要对大卫这样说：‘王不要什么聘礼，只要一百非利士人的阳皮，好在王的仇敌身上报仇。’”扫罗的意思要使大卫丧在非利士人的手里。


撒上18:26
> When the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become the king's son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed,
>
> 扫罗的臣仆将这话告诉大卫，大卫就欢喜作王的女婿。日期还没有到，


撒上18:27

>
> 大卫和跟随他的人起身前往，杀了二百非利士人，将阳皮满数交给王，为要作王的女婿。于是，扫罗将女儿米甲给大卫为妻。


撒上18:28
> When Saul realized that the LORD was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David,
>
> 扫罗见耶和华与大卫同在，又知道女儿米甲爱大卫，


撒上18:29

撒上19:1

>
> 扫罗对他儿子约拿单和众臣仆说要杀大卫；扫罗的儿子约拿单却甚喜爱大卫。


撒上19:2
> and warned him, "My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Be on your guard tomorrow morning; go into hiding and stay there.
>
> 约拿单告诉大卫说：“我父扫罗想要杀你，所以明日早晨你要小心，到一个僻静地方藏身。


撒上19:3

撒上19:5
> He took his life in his hands when he killed the Philistine. The LORD won a great victory for all Israel, and you saw it and were glad. Why then would you do wrong to an innocent man like David by killing him for no reason?"
>
> 他拚命杀那非利士人，耶和华为以色列众人大行拯救。那时你看见，甚是欢喜；现在为何无故要杀大卫，流无辜人的血，自己取罪呢？”


撒上19:6
> Saul listened to Jonathan and took this oath: "As surely as the LORD lives, David will not be put to death."
>
> 扫罗听了约拿单的话，就指着永生的耶和华起誓说：“我必不杀他。”


撒上19:7
> So Jonathan called David and told him the whole conversation. He brought him to Saul, and David was with Saul as before.
>
> 约拿单叫大卫来，把这一切事告诉他，带他去见扫罗。他就仍然侍立在扫罗面前。


撒上19:8

> 从耶和华那里来的恶魔又降在扫罗身上（扫罗手里拿枪坐在屋里），大卫就用手弹琴。


撒上19:10
> Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear, but David eluded him as Saul drove the spear into the wall. That night David made good his escape.
>
> 扫罗用枪想要刺透大卫，钉在墙上；他却躲开，扫罗的枪刺入墙内。当夜大卫逃走，躲避了。


撒上19:11

> So Michal let David down through a window, and he fled and escaped.
>
> 于是，米甲将大卫从窗户里缒下去，大卫就逃走，躲避了。

> Then Michal took an idol and laid it on the bed, covering it with a garment and putting some goats' hair at the head.

> 使者进去，看见床上有神像，头枕在山羊毛装的枕头上。


撒上19:17
> Saul said to Michal, "Why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy away so that he escaped?" Michal told him, "He said to me, 'Let me get away. Why should I kill you?'"
>
> 扫罗对米甲说：“你为什么这样欺哄我，放我仇敌逃走呢？”米甲回答说：“他对我说：‘你放我走，不然我要杀你。’”


撒上19:18
> When David had fled and made his escape, he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there.

> 大卫逃避，来到拉玛见撒母耳，将扫罗向他所行的事述说了一遍。他和撒母耳就往拿约去居住。


撒上19:19
> Word came to Saul: "David is in Naioth at Ramah";
>
> 有人告诉扫罗说：“大卫在拉玛的拿约。”。

撒上19:22
> Finally, he himself left for Ramah and went to the great cistern at Secu. And he asked, "Where are Samuel and David?" "Over in Naioth at Ramah," they said.
>
> 然后扫罗自己往拉玛去，到了西沽的大井，问人说：“撒母耳和大卫在哪里呢？”有人说：“在拉玛的拿约。”


撒上19:23
> So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah. But the Spirit of God came even upon him, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth.
>
> 他就往拉玛的拿约去。　神的灵也感动他，一面走一面说话，直到拉玛的拿约。


撒上19:24
> He stripped off his robes and also prophesied in Samuel's presence. He lay that way all that day and night. This is why people say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
>
> 他就脱了衣服，在撒母耳面前受感说话，一昼一夜露体躺卧。因此有句俗语说：“扫罗也列在先知中吗？”


## 撒母耳记上第20章
撒上20:1
> Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, "What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father, that he is trying to take my life?"
>
> 大卫从拉玛的拿约逃跑，来到约拿单那里，对他说：“我做了什么，有什么罪孽呢？在你父亲面前犯了什么罪，他竟寻索我的性命呢？”


撒上20:2
> "Never!" Jonathan replied. "You are not going to die! Look, my father doesn't do anything, great or small, without confiding in me. Why would he hide this from me? It's not so!"
>
> 约拿单回答说：“断然不是！你必不至死。我父做事，无论大小，没有不叫我知道的。怎么独有这事隐瞒我呢？决不如此。”


撒上20:3
> But David took an oath and said, "Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself, 'Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.' Yet as surely as the LORD lives and as you live, there is only a step between me and death."
>
> 大卫又起誓说：“你父亲准知我在你眼前蒙恩。他心里说：‘不如不叫约拿单知道，恐怕他愁烦。’我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我离死不过一步。”


撒上20:4
> Jonathan said to David, "Whatever you want me to do, I'll do for you."
>
> 约拿单对大卫说：“你心里所求的，我必为你成就。”


撒上20:5

撒上20:8
> As for you, show kindness to your servant, for you have brought him into a covenant with you before the LORD. If I am guilty, then kill me yourself! Why hand me over to your father?"
>
> 求你施恩与仆人，因你在耶和华面前曾与仆人结盟。我若有罪，不如你自己杀我，何必将我交给你父亲呢？”


撒上20:9
> "Never!" Jonathan said. "If I had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn't I tell you?"
>
> 约拿单说：“断无此事！我若知道我父亲决意害你，我岂不告诉你呢？”


撒上20:10
> David asked, "Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?"
>
> 大卫对约拿单说：“你父亲若用厉言回答你，谁来告诉我呢？”


撒上20:11
> "Come," Jonathan said, "let's go out into the field." So they went there together.
>
> 约拿单对大卫说：“你我且往田野去。”二人就往田野去了。


撒上20:12
> Then Jonathan said to David: "By the LORD, the God of Israel, I will surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow! If he is favorably disposed toward you, will I not send you word and let you know?
>
> 约拿单对大卫说：“愿耶和华以色列的　神为证。明日约在这时候，或第三日，我探我父亲的意思，若向你有好意，我岂不打发人告诉你吗？


撒上20:13
> But if my father is inclined to harm you, may the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I do not let you know and send you away safely. May the LORD be with you as he has been with my father.
>
> 我父亲若有意害你，我不告诉你，使你平平安安地走，愿耶和华重重地降罚与我。愿耶和华与你同在，如同从前与我父亲同在一样。


撒上20:14
> But show me unfailing kindness like that of the LORD as long as I live, so that I may not be killed,
>
> 你要照耶和华的慈爱恩待我。不但我活着的时候免我死亡，


撒上20:15
> and do not ever cut off your kindness from my family--not even when the LORD has cut off every one of David's enemies from the face of the earth."
>
> 就是我死后，耶和华从地上剪除你仇敌的时候，你也永不可向我家绝了恩惠。”


撒上20:16
> So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, "May the LORD call David's enemies to account."
>
> 于是，约拿单与大卫家结盟说：“愿耶和华借大卫的仇敌追讨背约的罪。”


撒上20:17
> And Jonathan had David reaffirm his oath out of love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself.
>
> 约拿单因爱大卫如同爱自己的性命，就使他再起誓。


撒上20:18
> Then Jonathan said to David: "Tomorrow is the New Moon festival. You will be missed, because your seat will be empty.
>
> 约拿单对他说：“明日是初一，你的座位空设，人必理会你不在那里。


撒上20:19
> The day after tomorrow, toward evening, go to the place where you hid when this trouble began, and wait by the stone Ezel.
>
> 你等三日，就要速速下去，到你从前遇事所藏的地方，在以色磐石在那里等候。


撒上20:20
> I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I were shooting at a target.
>
> 我要向磐石旁边射三箭，如同射箭靶一样。


撒上20:21
> Then I will send a boy and say, 'Go, find the arrows.' If I say to him, 'Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them here,' then come, because, as surely as the LORD lives, you are safe; there is no danger.
>
> 我要打发童子说：‘去把箭找来。’我若对童子说：‘箭在后头，把箭拿来’，你就可以回来，我指着永生的耶和华起誓，你必平安无事。


撒上20:22
> But if I say to the boy, 'Look, the arrows are beyond you,' then you must go, because the LORD has sent you away.
>
> 我若对童子说：‘箭在前头’，你就要去，因为是耶和华打发你去的。


撒上20:23
> And about the matter you and I discussed--remember, the LORD is witness between you and me forever."
>

撒上20:24
> So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon festival came, the king sat down to eat.
>
> 大卫就去藏在田野。到了初一日，王坐席要吃饭。


撒上20:25
> He sat in his customary place by the wall, opposite Jonathan, and Abner sat next to Saul, but David's place was empty.
>
> 王照常坐在靠墙的位上，约拿单侍立，押尼珥坐在扫罗旁边，大卫的座位空设。


撒上20:26
> Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, "Something must have happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean--surely he is unclean."
>
> 然而这日扫罗没有说什么，他想大卫遇事，偶染不洁，他必定是不洁。


撒上20:27
> But the next day, the second day of the month, David's place was empty again. Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, "Why hasn't the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?"
>
> 初二日，大卫的座位还空设。扫罗问他儿子约拿单说：“耶西的儿子为何昨日今日没有来吃饭呢？”


撒上20:28
> Jonathan answered, "David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem.
>
> 约拿单回答扫罗说：“大卫切求我容他往伯利恒去。


撒上20:29
> He said, 'Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there. If I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away to see my brothers.' That is why he has not come to the king's table."
>
> 他说：‘求你容我去，因为我家在城里有献祭的事，我长兄吩咐我去。如今我若在你眼前蒙恩，求你容我去见我的弟兄。’所以大卫没有赴王的席。”


撒上20:30
> Saul's anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, "You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don't I know that you have sided with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you?
>
> 扫罗向约拿单发怒，对他说：“你这顽梗背逆之妇人所生的，我岂不知道你喜悦耶西的儿子，自取羞辱，以致你母亲露体蒙羞吗？


撒上20:31
> As long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send and bring him to me, for he must die!"
>
> 耶西的儿子若在世间活着，你和你的国位必站立不住。现在你要打发人去，将他捉拿交给我。他是该死的！”


撒上20:32
> "Why should he be put to death? What has he done?" Jonathan asked his father.
>
> 约拿单对父亲扫罗说：“他为什么该死呢？他做了什么呢？”


撒上20:33
> But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David.
>

撒上20:34
> Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day of the month he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father's shameful treatment of David.
>
> 于是约拿单气忿忿地从席上起来，在这初二日没有吃饭。他因见父亲羞辱大卫，就为大卫愁烦。


撒上20:35
> In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him,
>
> 次日早晨，约拿单按着与大卫约会的时候出到田野，有一个童子跟随。

> and he said to the boy, "Run and find the arrows I shoot." As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
>
> 约拿单对童子说：“你跑去，把我所射的箭找来。”童子跑去，约拿单就把箭射在童子前头。


撒上20:37
> When the boy came to the place where Jonathan's arrow had fallen, Jonathan called out after him, "Isn't the arrow beyond you?"
>
> 童子到了约拿单落箭之地，约拿单呼叫童子说：“箭不是在你前头吗？”


撒上20:38
> Then he shouted, "Hurry! Go quickly! Don't stop!" The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master.
>
> 约拿单又呼叫童子说：“速速地去，不要迟延！”童子就拾起箭来，回到主人那里。


撒上20:39
> (The boy knew nothing of all this; only Jonathan and David knew.)
>
> 童子却不知道这是什么意思，只有约拿单和大卫知道。


撒上20:40
> Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said, "Go, carry them back to town."
>
> 约拿单将弓箭交给童子，吩咐说：“你拿到城里去。”


撒上20:41
> After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together--but David wept the most.
>
> 童子一去，大卫就从磐石的南边出来，俯伏在地，拜了三拜。二人亲嘴，彼此哭泣，大卫哭得更恸。


撒上20:42
> Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the LORD, saying, 'The LORD is witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants forever.'" Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the town.
>
> 约拿单对大卫说：“我们二人曾指着耶和华的名起誓说：‘愿耶和华在你我中间，并你我后裔中间为证，直到永远。’如今你平平安安地去吧！”大卫就起身走了；约拿单也回城里去了。


## 撒母耳记上第21章
撒上21:1
> David went to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech trembled when he met him, and asked, "Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?"
>
> 大卫到了挪伯祭司亚希米勒那里。亚希米勒战战兢地出来迎接他，问他说：“你为什么独自来，没有人跟随呢？”


撒上21:2
> David answered Ahimelech the priest, "The king charged me with a certain matter and said to me, 'No one is to know anything about your mission and your instructions.' As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place.
>
> 大卫回答祭司亚希米勒说：“王吩咐我一件事说：‘我差遣你委托你的这件事，不要使人知道。’故此我已派定少年人在某处等候我。


撒上21:3
> Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you can find."
>
> 现在你手下有什么？求你给我五个饼，或是别样的食物。”


撒上21:4
> But the priest answered David, "I don't have any ordinary bread on hand; however, there is some consecrated bread here--provided the men have kept themselves from women."
>
> 祭司对大卫说：“我手下没有寻常的饼，只有圣饼，若少年人没有亲近妇人才可以给。”


撒上21:5
> David replied, "Indeed women have been kept from us, as usual whenever I set out. The men's things are holy even on missions that are not holy. How much more so today!"
>
> 大卫对祭司说：“实在约有三日我们没有亲近妇人。我出来的时候，虽是寻常行路，少年人的器皿还是洁净的；何况今日不更是洁净吗？”


撒上21:6
> So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the LORD and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away.
>
> 祭司就拿圣饼给他，因为在那里没有别样饼，只有更换新饼，从耶和华面前撤下来的陈设饼。


撒上21:7
> Now one of Saul's servants was there that day, detained before the LORD; he was Doeg the Edomite, Saul's head shepherd.
>
> 当日有扫罗的一个臣子留在耶和华面前。他名叫多益，是以东人，作扫罗的司牧长。


撒上21:8
> David asked Ahimelech, "Don't you have a spear or a sword here? I haven't brought my sword or any other weapon, because the king's business was urgent."
>
> 大卫问亚希米勒说：“你手下有枪有刀没有？因为王的事甚急，连刀剑器械我都没有带。”


撒上21:9
> The priest replied, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it; there is no sword here but that one." David said, "There is none like it; give it to me."
>
> 祭司说：“你在以拉谷杀非利士人歌利亚的那刀在这里，裹在布中，放在以弗得后边，你要就可以拿去。除此以外，再没有别的。”大卫说：“这刀没有可比的！求你给我。”


撒上21:10
> That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath.
>
> 那日大卫起来，躲避扫罗，逃到迦特王亚吉那里。


撒上21:11
> But the servants of Achish said to him, "Isn't this David, the king of the land? Isn't he the one they sing about in their dances: "'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands'?"
>
> 亚吉的臣仆对亚吉说：“这不是以色列国王大卫吗？那里的妇女跳舞唱和，不是指着他说‘扫罗杀死千千，大卫杀死万万’吗？”


撒上21:12
> David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath.
>
> 大卫将这话放在心里，甚惧怕迦特王亚吉，


撒上21:13
> So he pretended to be insane in their presence; and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard.
>
> 就在众人面前改变了寻常的举动，在他们手下假装疯癫，在城门的门扇上胡写乱画，使唾沫流在胡子上。


撒上21:14
> Achish said to his servants, "Look at the man! He is insane! Why bring him to me?
>
> 亚吉对臣仆说：“你们看，这人是疯子。为什么带他到我这里来呢？

撒上25:29
> Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life, the life of my master will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the LORD your God. But the lives of your enemies he will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling.

撒上26:19
> Now let my lord the king listen to his servant's words. If the LORD has incited you against me, then may he accept an offering. If, however, men have done it, may they be cursed before the LORD! They have now driven me from my share in the LORD'S inheritance and have said, 'Go, serve other gods.'
>
> 求我主我王听仆人的话：若是耶和华激发你攻击我，愿耶和华收纳祭物；若是人激发你，愿他在耶和华面前受咒诅，因为他现今赶逐我，不容我在耶和华的产业上有，分，说：‘你去事奉别　神吧！’

>
> 大卫对亚吉说：“我若在你眼前蒙恩，求你在京外的城邑中赐我一个地方居住。仆人何必与王同住京都呢？”


撒上27:6

>
> 撒母耳对扫罗说：“你为什么搅扰我，招我上来呢？”扫罗回答说：“我甚窘急，因为非利士人攻击我，　神也离开我，不再借先知或梦回答我。因此请你上来，好指示我应当怎样行。”

> Samuel said, "Why do you consult me, now that the LORD has turned away from you and become your enemy?
>
> 撒母耳说：“耶和华已经离开你，且与你为敌，你何必问我呢？

> But the Philistine commanders were angry with him and said, "Send the man back, that he may return to the place you assigned him.
