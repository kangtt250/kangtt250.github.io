>
> 那民众多，身体高大，像亚衲人一样，但耶和华从亚扪人面前除灭他们，亚扪人就得了他们的地，接着居住。


申2:22
> The LORD had done the same for the descendants of Esau, who lived in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them. They drove them out and have lived in their place to this day.
>
> 正如耶和华从前为住西珥的以扫子孙，将何利人从他们面前除灭，他们得了何利人的地，接着居住一样，直到今日。


申2:23
> And as for the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorites coming out from Caphtor destroyed them and settled in their place.)

申2:30
> But Sihon king of Heshbon refused to let us pass through. For the LORD your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to give him into your hands, as he has now done.
>
> 但希实本王西宏不容我们从他那里经过，因为耶和华你的　神使他心中刚硬，性情顽梗，为要将他交在你手中，像今日一样。

申2:36
> From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the gorge, even as far as Gilead, not one town was too strong for us. The LORD our God gave us all of them.
>
> 从亚嫩谷边的亚罗珥和谷中的城，直到基列，耶和华我们的　神都交给我们了，没有一座城高得使我们不能攻取的。
