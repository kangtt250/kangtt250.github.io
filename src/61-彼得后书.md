# 彼得后书
## 彼得后书第1章
彼后1:1
> Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours:
>
> 作耶稣基督仆人和使徒的西门彼得，写信给那因我们的　神和（有古卷无“和”字）救主耶稣基督之义，与我们同得一样宝贵信心的人：


彼后1:2
> Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
>
> 愿恩惠、平安因你们认识　神和我们主耶稣，多多地加给你们！


彼后1:3
> His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness.
>
> 神的　神能已将一切关乎生命和虔敬的事赐给我们，皆因我们认识那用自己荣耀和美德召我们的主。


彼后1:4
> Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.
>
> 因此，他已将又宝贵、又极大的应许赐给我们，叫我们既脱离世上从情欲来的败坏，就得与　神的性情有分。


彼后1:5
> For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge;
>
> 正因这缘故，你们要分外地殷勤。有了信心，又要加上德行；有了德行，又要加上知识；


彼后1:6
> and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness;
>
> 有了知识，又要加上节制；有了节制，又要加上忍耐；有了忍耐，又要加上虔敬；


彼后1:7
> and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love.
>
> 有了虔敬，又要加上爱弟兄的心；有了爱弟兄的心，又要加上爱众人的心。


彼后1:8
> For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
>
> 你们若充充足足地有这几样，就必使你们在认识我们的主耶稣基督上，不至于闲懒不结果子了。


彼后1:9
> But if anyone does not have them, he is nearsighted and blind, and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his past sins.
>
> 人若没有这几样，就是眼瞎，只看见近处的，忘了他旧日的罪已经得了洁净。


彼后1:10
> Therefore, my brothers, be all the more eager to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, you will never fall,
>
> 所以弟兄们，应当更加殷勤，使你们所蒙的恩召和拣选坚定不移。你们若行这几样，就永不失脚。


彼后1:11
> and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
>
> 这样，必叫你们丰丰富富地得以进入我们主救主耶稣基督永远的国。


彼后1:12
> So I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have.
>
> 你们虽然晓得这些事，并且在你们已有的真道上坚固，我却要将这些事常常提醒你们。


彼后1:13
> I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body,
>
> 我以为应当趁我还在这帐棚的时候提醒你们，激发你们。


彼后1:14
> because I know that I will soon put it aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.
>
> 因为知道我脱离这帐棚的时候快到了，正如我们主耶稣基督所指示我的。


彼后1:15
> And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things.
>
> 并且我要尽心竭力，使你们在我去世以后时常记念这些事。


彼后1:16
> We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
>
> 我们从前将我们主耶稣基督的大能，和他降临的事告诉你们，并不是随从乖巧捏造的虚言，乃是亲眼见过他的威荣。


彼后1:17
> For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
>
> 他从父　神得尊贵荣耀的时候，从极大荣光之中有声音出来向他说：“这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的。”


彼后1:18
> We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain.
>
> 我们同他在圣山的时候，亲自听见这声音从天上出来。


彼后1:19
> And we have the word of the prophets made more certain, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
>
> 我们并有先知更确的预言，如同灯照在暗处。你们在这预言上留意，直等到天发亮，晨星在你们心里出现的时候，才是好的。


彼后1:20
> Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation.
>
> 第一要紧的，该知道经上所有的预言没有可随私意解说的；


彼后1:21
> For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
>
> 因为豫言从来没有出于人意的，乃是人被圣灵感动，说出　神的话来。


## 彼得后书第2章
彼后2:1
> But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them--bringing swift destruction on themselves.
>
> 从前在百姓中有假先知起来，将来在你们中间也必有假师傅，私自引进陷害人的异端，连买他们的主他们也不承认，自取速速的灭亡。


彼后2:2
> Many will follow their shameful ways and will bring the way of truth into disrepute.
>
> 将有许多人随从他们邪淫的行为，便叫真道因他们的缘故被毁谤。


彼后2:3
> In their greed these teachers will exploit you with stories they have made up. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping.
>
> 他们因有贪心，要用捏造的言语在你们身上取利。他们的刑罚，自古以来并不迟延；他们的灭亡，也必速速来到（原文作“也不打盹”）。


彼后2:4
> For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them into gloomy dungeons to be held for judgment;
>
> 就是天使犯了罪，　神也没有宽容，曾把他们丢在地狱，交在黑暗坑中，等候审判；


彼后2:5
> if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others;
>
> 神也没有宽容上古的世代，曾叫洪水临到那不敬虔的世代，却保护了传义道的挪亚一家八口；


彼后2:6
> if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly;
>
> 又判定所多玛、蛾摩拉，将二城倾覆，焚烧成灰，作为后世不敬虔人的监戒；


彼后2:7
> and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men
>
> 只搭救了那常为恶人淫行忧伤的义人罗得。


彼后2:8
> (for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)--
>
> 因为那义人住在他们中间，看见听见他们不法的事，他的义心就天天伤痛。


彼后2:9
> if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue godly men from trials and to hold the unrighteous for the day of judgment, while continuing their punishment.
>
> 主知道搭救敬虔的人脱离试探，把不义的人留在刑罚之下，等候审判的日子。


彼后2:10
> This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the sinful nature and despise authority. Bold and arrogant, these men are not afraid to slander celestial beings;
>
> 那些随肉身纵污秽的情欲、轻慢主治之人的，更是如此。他们胆大任性，毁谤在尊位的也不知惧怕。


彼后2:11
> yet even angels, although they are stronger and more powerful, do not bring slanderous accusations against such beings in the presence of the Lord.
>
> 就是天使，虽然力量权能更大，还不用毁谤的话在主面前告他们。


彼后2:12
> But these men blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like brute beasts, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, and like beasts they too will perish.
>
> 但这些人好像没有灵性，生来就是畜类，以备捉拿宰杀的。他们毁谤所不晓得的事，正在败坏人的时候，自己必遭遇败坏。


彼后2:13
> They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you.
>
> 行的不义，就得了不义的工价。这些人喜爱白昼宴乐，他们已被玷污，又有瑕疵，正与你们一同坐席，就以自己的诡诈为快乐。


彼后2:14
> With eyes full of adultery, they never stop sinning; they seduce the unstable; they are experts in greed--an accursed brood!
>
> 他们满眼是淫色（“淫色”原文作“淫妇”），止不住犯罪，引诱那心不坚固的人，心中习惯了贪婪，正是被咒诅的种类。


彼后2:15
> They have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Beor, who loved the wages of wickedness.
>
> 他们离弃正路，就走差了，随从比珥之子巴兰的路。巴兰就是那贪爱不义之工价的先知，


彼后2:16
> But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey--a beast without speech--who spoke with a man's voice and restrained the prophet's madness.
>
> 他却为自己的过犯受了责备；那不能说话的驴，以人言拦阻先知的狂妄。


彼后2:17
> These men are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them.
>
> 这些人是无水的井，是狂风催逼的雾气，有墨黑的幽暗为他们存留。


彼后2:18
> For they mouth empty, boastful words and, by appealing to the lustful desires of sinful human nature, they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error.
>
> 他们说虚妄矜夸的大话，用肉身的情欲和邪淫的事引诱那些刚才脱离妄行的人。


彼后2:19
> They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity--for a man is a slave to whatever has mastered him.
>
> 他们应许人得以自由，自己却作败坏的奴仆，因为人被谁制伏，就是谁的奴仆。


彼后2:20
> If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning.
>
> 倘若他们因认识主救主耶稣基督，得以脱离世上的污秽，后来又在其中被缠住制伏，他们末后的景况就比先前更不好了。


彼后2:21
> It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them.
>
> 他们晓得义路，竟背弃了传给他们的圣命，倒不如不晓得为妙。


彼后2:22
> Of them the proverbs are true: "A dog returns to its vomit," and, "A sow that is washed goes back to her wallowing in the mud."
>
> 俗语说得真不错：“狗所吐的，它转过来又吃；猪洗净了，又回到泥里去滚。”这话在他们身上正合式。


## 彼得后书第3章
彼后3:1
> Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you. I have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking.
>
> 亲爱的弟兄啊，我现在写给你们的是第二封信。这两封都是提醒你们，激发你们诚实的心，


彼后3:2
> I want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles.
>
> 叫你们记念圣先知预先所说的话和主救主的命令，就是使徒所传给你们的。


彼后3:3
> First of all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires.
>
> 第一要紧的，该知道在末世必有好讥诮的人，随从自己的私欲出来讥诮说：


彼后3:4
> They will say, "Where is this 'coming' he promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation."
>
> “主要降临的应许在哪里呢？因为从列祖睡了以来，万物与起初创造的时候仍是一样。”


彼后3:5
> But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water.
>
> 他们故意忘记，从太古凭　神的命有了天，并从水而出藉水而成的地。


彼后3:6
> By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed.
>
> 故此，当时的世界被水淹没就消灭了。


彼后3:7
> By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
>
> 但现在的天地还是凭着那命存留，直留到不敬虔之人受审判遭沉沦的日子，用火焚烧。


彼后3:8
> But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.
>
> 亲爱的弟兄啊，有一件事你们不可忘记，就是主看一日如千年，千年如一日。


彼后3:9
> The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.
>
> 主所应许的尚未成就，有人以为他是耽延，其实不是耽延，乃是宽容你们，不愿有一人沉沦，乃愿人人都悔改。


彼后3:10
> But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything in it will be laid bare.
>
> 但主的日子要像贼来到一样。那日，天必大有响声废去，有形质的都要被烈火销化，地和其上的物都要烧尽了。


彼后3:11
> Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives
>
> 这一切既然都要如此销化，你们为人该当怎样圣洁、怎样敬虔，


彼后3:12
> as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat.
>
> 切切仰望　神的日子来到。在那日，天被火烧就销化了，有形质的都要被烈火熔化。


彼后3:13
> But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, the home of righteousness.
>
> 但我们照他的应许，盼望新天新地，有义居在其中。


彼后3:14
> So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him.
>
> 亲爱的弟兄啊，你们既盼望这些事，就当殷勤，使自己没有玷污，无可指摘，安然见主。


彼后3:15
> Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him.
>
> 并且要以我主长久忍耐为得救的因由，就如我们所亲爱的兄弟保罗，照着所赐给他的智慧写了信给你们。


彼后3:16
> He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.
>
> 他一切的信上也都是讲论这事。信中有些难明白的，那无学问、不坚固的人强解，如强解别的经书一样，就自取沉沦。


彼后3:17
> Therefore, dear friends, since you already know this, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your secure position.
>
> 亲爱的弟兄阿，你们既然豫先知道这事，就当防备，恐怕被恶人的错谬诱惑，就从自己坚固的地步上坠落。


彼后3:18
> But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever! Amen.
>
> 你们却要在我们主救主耶稣基督的恩典和知识上有长进。愿荣耀归给他，从今直到永远。阿们。
