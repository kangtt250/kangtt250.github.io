Curiosity has its own reason for existence.


If you want to be rewarded, you have to be irreplaceable.

If you want to be irreplaceable, you have to be unique.

If you want to be unique, you have to be authentic.

If you want to be authentic, stop listening to everyone and everything else. 

It’s drowning “you” out.

The most **entertaining** outcome is the most likely ~ :)
