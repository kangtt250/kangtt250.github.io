# 彼得前书
## 彼得前书第1章
彼前1:1
> Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To God's elect, strangers in the world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia,
>
> 耶稣基督的使徒彼得，写信给那分散在本都、加拉太、加帕多家、亚西亚、庇推尼寄居的，


彼前1:2
> who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance.
>
> 就是照父　神的先见被拣选，藉着圣灵得成圣洁，以致顺服耶稣基督，又蒙他血所洒的人：愿恩惠、平安多多地加给你们！


彼前1:3
> Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
>
> 愿颂赞归与我们主耶稣基督的父　神。他曾照自己的大怜悯，藉耶稣基督从死里复活，重生了我们，叫我们有活泼的盼望，


彼前1:4
> and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade--kept in heaven for you,
>
> 可以得着不能朽坏、不能玷污、不能衰残、为你们存留在天上的基业。


彼前1:5
> who through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.
>
> 你们这因信蒙　神能力保守的人，必能得着所预备、到末世要显现的救恩。


彼前1:6
> In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.
>
> 因此，你们是大有喜乐。但如今在百般的试炼中暂时忧愁，


彼前1:7
> These have come so that your faith--of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire--may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.
>
> 叫你们的信心既被试验，就比那被火试验仍然能坏的金子更显宝贵，可以在耶稣基督显现的时候，得着称赞、荣耀、尊贵。


彼前1:8
> Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy,
>
> 你们虽然没有见过他，却是爱他；如今虽不得看见，却因信他就有说不出来、满有荣光的大喜乐，


彼前1:9
> for you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
>
> 并且得着你们信心的果效，就是灵魂的救恩。


彼前1:10
> Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care,
>
> 论到这救恩，那预先说你们要得恩典的众先知早已详细地寻求考察，


彼前1:11
> trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow.
>
> 就是考察在他们心里基督的灵，预先证明基督受苦难，后来得荣耀，是指着什么时候，并怎样的时候。


彼前1:12
> It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things.
>
> 他们得了启示，知道他们所传讲的一切事（“传讲”原文作“服事”），不是为自己，乃是为你们。那靠着从天上差来的圣灵传福音给你们的人，现在将这些事报给你们，天使也愿意详细察看这些事。


彼前1:13
> Therefore, prepare your minds for action; be self-controlled; set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed.
>
> 所以要约束你们的心（原文作“束上你们心中的腰”），谨慎自守，专心盼望耶稣基督显现的时候所带来给你们的恩。


彼前1:14
> As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance.
>
> 你们既作顺命的儿女，就不要效法从前蒙昧无知的时候那放纵私欲的样子。


彼前1:15
> But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do;
>
> 那召你们的既是圣洁，你们在一切所行的事上也要圣洁。


彼前1:16
> for it is written: "Be holy, because I am holy."
>
> 因为经上记着说：“你们要圣洁，因为我是圣洁的。”


彼前1:17
> Since you call on a Father who judges each man's work impartially, live your lives as strangers here in reverent fear.
>
> 你们既称那不偏待人、按各人行为审判人的主为父，就当存敬畏的心，度你们在世寄居的日子，


彼前1:18
> For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers,
>
> 知道你们得赎、脱去你们祖宗所传流虚妄的行为，不是凭着能坏的金银等物，


彼前1:19
> but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.
>
> 乃是凭着基督的宝血，如同无瑕疵、无玷污的羔羊之血。


彼前1:20
> He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake.
>
> 基督在创世以前是预先被　神知道的，却在这末世才为你们显现。


彼前1:21
> Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him, and so your faith and hope are in God.
>
> 你们也因着他，信那叫他从死里复活，又给他荣耀的　神，叫你们的信心和盼望都在于　神。


彼前1:22
> Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for your brothers, love one another deeply, from the heart.
>
> 你们既因顺从真理，洁净了自己的心，以致爱弟兄没有虚假，就当从心里彼此切实相爱（“从心鶪”有古卷作“从清洁的心”）。


彼前1:23
> For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God.
>
> 你们蒙了重生，不是由于能坏的种子，乃是由于不能坏的种子，是藉着　神活泼常存的道。


彼前1:24
> For, "All men are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall,
>
> 因为：“凡有血气的，尽都如草，他的美荣都像草上的花。草必枯干，花必凋谢；


彼前1:25
> but the word of the Lord stands forever." And this is the word that was preached to you.
>
> 惟有主的道是永存的。”所传给你们的福音就是这道。


## 彼得前书第2章
彼前2:1
> Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind.
>
> 所以，你们既除去一切的恶毒（或作“阴毒”）、诡诈并假善、嫉妒和一切毁谤的话，


彼前2:2
> Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,
>
> 就要爱慕那纯净的灵奶，像才生的婴孩爱慕奶一样，叫你们因此渐长，以致得救。


彼前2:3
> now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.
>
> 你们若尝过主恩的滋味，就必如此。


彼前2:4
> As you come to him, the living Stone--rejected by men but chosen by God and precious to him--
>
> 主乃活石，固然是被人所弃的，却是被　神所拣选、所宝贵的。


彼前2:5
> you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
>
> 你们来到主面前，也就像活石，被建造成为灵宫，作圣洁的祭司，藉着耶稣基督奉献　神所悦纳的灵祭。


彼前2:6
> For in Scripture it says: "See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame."
>
> 因为经上说：“看哪，我把所拣选、所宝贵的房角石安放在锡安，信靠他的人必不至于羞愧。”


彼前2:7
> Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, "The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone,"
>
> 所以，他在你们信的人就为宝贵，在那不信的人有话说：“匠人所弃的石头，已作了房角的头块石头。”


彼前2:8
> and, "A stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall." They stumble because they disobey the message--which is also what they were destined for.
>
> 又说：“作了绊脚的石头，跌人的磐石。”他们既不顺从，就在道理上绊跌（或作“他们绊跌都因不顺从道理”）。他们这样绊跌，也是预定的。


彼前2:9
> But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.
>
> 惟有你们是被拣选的族类，是有君尊的祭司，是圣洁的国度，是属　神的子民，要叫你们宣扬那召你们出黑暗、入奇妙光明者的美德。


彼前2:10
> Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
>
> 你们从前算不得子民，现在却作了　神的子民；从前未曾蒙怜恤，现在却蒙了怜恤。


彼前2:11
> Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from sinful desires, which war against your soul.
>
> 亲爱的弟兄啊，你们是客旅，是寄居的。我劝你们要禁戒肉体的私欲；这私欲是与灵魂争战的。


彼前2:12
> Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.
>
> 你们在外邦人中，应当品行端正，叫那些毁谤你们是作恶的，因看见你们的好行为，便在鉴察的日子（“鉴察”或作“眷顾”）归荣耀给　神。


彼前2:13
> Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority,
>
> 你们为主的缘故，要顺服人的一切制度，或是在上的君王，


彼前2:14
> or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.
>
> 或是君王所派罚恶赏善的臣宰。


彼前2:15
> For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish men.
>
> 因为　神的旨意原是要你们行善，可以堵住那糊涂无知人的口。


彼前2:16
> Live as free men, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as servants of God.
>
> 你们虽是自由的，却不可藉着自由遮盖恶毒（或作“阴毒”），总要作　神的仆人。


彼前2:17
> Show proper respect to everyone: Love the brotherhood of believers, fear God, honor the king.
>
> 务要尊敬众人，亲爱教中的弟兄，敬畏　神，尊敬君王。


彼前2:18
> Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh.
>
> 你们作仆人的，凡事要存敬畏的心顺服主人；不但顺服那善良温和的，就是那乖僻的也要顺服。


彼前2:19
> For it is commendable if a man bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God.
>
> 倘若人为叫良心对得住　神，就忍受冤屈的苦楚，这是可喜爱的。


彼前2:20
> But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God.
>
> 你们若因犯罪受责打，能忍耐，有什么可夸的呢？但你们若因行善受苦，能忍耐，这在　神看是可喜爱的。


彼前2:21
> To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps.
>
> 你们蒙召原是为此，因基督也为你们受过苦，给你们留下榜样，叫你们跟随他的脚踪行。


彼前2:22
> "He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth."
>
> “他并没有犯罪，口里也没有诡诈。”


彼前2:23
> When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.
>
> 他被骂不还口，受害不说威吓的话，只将自己交托那按公义审判人的主。


彼前2:24
> He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed.
>
> 他被挂在木头上，亲身担当了我们的罪，使我们既然在罪上死，就得以在义上活。因他受的鞭伤，你们便得了医治。


彼前2:25
> For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
>
> 你们从前好像迷路的羊，如今却归到你们灵魂的牧人监督了。


## 彼得前书第3章
彼前3:1
> Wives, in the same way be submissive to your husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives,
>
> 你们作妻子的要顺服自己的丈夫。这样，若有不信从道理的丈夫，他们虽然不听道，也可以因妻子的品行被感化过来。


彼前3:2
> when they see the purity and reverence of your lives.
>
> 这正是因看见你们有贞洁的品行和敬畏的心。


彼前3:3
> Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and fine clothes.
>
> 你们不要以外面的辫头发、戴金饰、穿美衣为妆饰，


彼前3:4
> Instead, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight.
>
> 只要以里面存着长久温柔、安静的心为妆饰，这在　神面前是极宝贵的。


彼前3:5
> For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to make themselves beautiful. They were submissive to their own husbands,
>
> 因为古时仰赖　神的圣洁妇人，正是以此为妆饰，顺服自己的丈夫，


彼前3:6
> like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her master. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear.
>
> 就如撒拉听从亚伯拉罕，称他为主。你们若行善，不因恐吓而害怕，便是撒拉的女儿了。


彼前3:7
> Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.
>
> 你们作丈夫的也要按情理和妻子同住（“情理”原文作“知识”），因她比你软弱（“比你软弱”原文作“是软弱的器皿”），与你一同承受生命之恩的，所以要敬重她。这样，便叫你们的祷告没有阻碍。


彼前3:8
> Finally, all of you, live in harmony with one another; be sympathetic, love as brothers, be compassionate and humble.
>
> 总而言之，你们都要同心，彼此体恤，相爱如弟兄，存慈怜谦卑的心；


彼前3:9
> Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing.
>
> 不以恶报恶、以辱骂还辱骂，倒要祝福；因你们是为此蒙召，好叫你们承受福气。


彼前3:10
> For, "Whoever would love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from deceitful speech.
>
> 因为经上说：“人若爱生命，愿享美福，须要禁止舌头不出恶言，嘴唇不说诡诈的话；


彼前3:11
> He must turn from evil and do good; he must seek peace and pursue it.
>
> 也要离恶行善，寻求和睦，一心追赶。


彼前3:12
> For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."
>
> 因为主的眼看顾义人，主的耳听他们的祈祷；惟有行恶的人，主向他们变脸。”


彼前3:13
> Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good?
>
> 你们若是热心行善，有谁害你们呢？


彼前3:14
> But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. "Do not fear what they fear; do not be frightened."
>
> 你们就是为义受苦，也是有福的。不要怕人的威吓，也不要惊慌（“的威吓”或作“所怕的”），


彼前3:15
> But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect,
>
> 只要心里尊主基督为圣。有人问你们心中盼望的缘由，就要常作准备，以温柔、敬畏的心回答各人。


彼前3:16
> keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander.
>
> 存着无亏的良心，叫你们在何事上被毁谤，就在何事上可以叫那诬赖你们在基督里有好品行的人自觉羞愧。


彼前3:17
> It is better, if it is God's will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.
>
> 神的旨意若是叫你们因行善受苦，总强如因行恶受苦。


彼前3:18
> For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit,
>
> 因基督也曾一次为罪受苦（“受苦”有古卷作“受死”），就是义的代替不义的，为要引我们到　神面前。按着肉体说，他被治死；按着灵性说，他复活了。


彼前3:19
> through whom also he went and preached to the spirits in prison
>
> 他藉这灵曾去传道给那些在监狱里的灵听，


彼前3:20
> who disobeyed long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water,
>
> 就是那从前在挪亚预备方舟、　神容忍等待的时候，不信从的人。当时进入方舟，藉着水得救的不多，只有八个人。


彼前3:21
> and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also--not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
>
> 这水所表明的洗礼，现在藉着耶稣基督复活，也拯救你们；这洗礼本不在乎除掉肉体的污秽，只求在　神面前有无亏的良心。


彼前3:22
> who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand--with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him.
>
> 耶稣已经进入天堂，在　神的右边，众天使和有权柄的，并有能力的，都服从了他。


## 彼得前书第4章
彼前4:1
> Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because he who has suffered in his body is done with sin.
>
> 基督既在肉身受苦，你们也当将这样的心志作为兵器，因为在肉身受过苦的，就已经与罪断绝了。


彼前4:2
> As a result, he does not live the rest of his earthly life for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God.
>
> 你们存这样的心，从今以后，就可以不从人的情欲，只从　神的旨意在世度余下的光阴。


彼前4:3
> For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do--living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry.
>
> 因为往日随从外邦人的心意行邪淫、恶欲、醉酒、荒宴、群饮，并可恶拜偶像的事，时候已经够了。


彼前4:4
> They think it strange that you do not plunge with them into the same flood of dissipation, and they heap abuse on you.
>
> 他们在这些事上，见你们不与他们同奔那放荡无度的路，就以为怪，毁谤你们。


彼前4:5
> But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
>
> 他们必在那将要审判活人死人的主面前交账。


彼前4:6
> For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so that they might be judged according to men in regard to the body, but live according to God in regard to the spirit.
>
> 为此，就是死人也曾有福音传给他们，要叫他们的肉体按着人受审判，他们的灵性却靠　神活着。


彼前4:7
> The end of all things is near. Therefore be clear minded and self-controlled so that you can pray.
>
> 万物的结局近了。所以你们要谨慎自守，儆醒祷告。


彼前4:8
> Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.
>
> 最要紧的是彼此切实相爱，因为爱能遮掩许多的罪。


彼前4:9
> Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.
>
> 你们要互相款待，不发怨言。


彼前4:10
> Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms.
>
> 各人要照所得的恩赐彼此服事，作　神百般恩赐的好管家。


彼前4:11
> If anyone speaks, he should do it as one speaking the very words of God. If anyone serves, he should do it with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.
>
> 若有讲道的，要按着　神的圣言讲；若有服事人的，要按着　神所赐的力量服事，叫　神在凡事上因耶稣基督得荣耀。原来荣耀、权能都是他的，直到永永远远。阿们！


彼前4:12
> Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you.
>
> 亲爱的弟兄啊，有火炼的试验临到你们，不要以为奇怪（似乎是遭遇非常的事），


彼前4:13
> But rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed.
>
> 倒要欢喜。因为你们是与基督一同受苦，使你们在他荣耀显现的时候，也可以欢喜快乐。


彼前4:14
> If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.
>
> 你们若为基督的名受辱骂，便是有福的，因为　神荣耀的灵常住在你们身上。


彼前4:15
> If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler.
>
> 你们中间却不可有人因为杀人、偷窃、作恶、好管闲事而受苦；


彼前4:16
> However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name.
>
> 若为作基督徒受苦，却不要羞耻，倒要因这名归荣耀给　神。


彼前4:17
> For it is time for judgment to begin with the family of God; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God?
>
> 因为时候到了，审判要从　神的家起首。若是先从我们起首，那不信从　神福音的人将有何等的结局呢？


彼前4:18
> And, "If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?"
>
> “若是义人仅仅得救，那不虔敬和犯罪的人将有何地可站呢？”


彼前4:19
> So then, those who suffer according to God's will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.
>
> 所以，那照　神旨意受苦的人要一心为善，将自己灵魂交与那信实的造化之主。


## 彼得前书第5章
彼前5:1
> To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow elder, a witness of Christ's sufferings and one who also will share in the glory to be revealed:
>
> 我这作长老、作基督受苦的见证、同享后来所要显现之荣耀的，劝你们中间与我同作长老的人：


彼前5:2
> Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care, serving as overseers--not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not greedy for money, but eager to serve;
>
> 务要牧养在你们中间　神的群羊，按着　神旨意照管他们；不是出于勉强，乃是出于甘心；也不是因为贪财，乃是出于乐意；


彼前5:3
> not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.
>
> 也不是辖制所托付你们的，乃是作群羊的榜样。


彼前5:4
> And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.
>
> 到了牧长显现的时候，你们必得那永不衰残的荣耀冠冕。


彼前5:5
> Young men, in the same way be submissive to those who are older. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."
>
> 你们年幼的也要顺服年长的。就是你们众人也都要以谦卑束腰，彼此顺服，因为“　神阻挡骄傲的人，赐恩给谦卑的人。”


彼前5:6
> Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time.
>
> 所以你们要自卑，服在　神大能的手下，到了时候，他必叫你们升高。


彼前5:7
> Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.
>
> 你们要将一切的忧虑卸给　神，因为他顾念你们。


彼前5:8
> Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.
>
> 务要谨守，儆醒。因为你们的仇敌魔鬼，如同吼叫的狮子，遍地游行，寻找可吞吃的人。


彼前5:9
> Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings.
>
> 你们要用坚固的信心抵挡他，因为知道你们在世上的众弟兄也是经历这样的苦难。


彼前5:10
> And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast.
>
> 那赐诸般恩典的　神曾在基督里召你们，得享他永远的荣耀，等你们暂受苦难之后，必要亲自成全你们，坚固你们，赐力量给你们。


彼前5:11
> To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen.
>
> 愿权能归给他，直到永永远远。阿们!


彼前5:12
> With the help of Silas, whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it.
>
> 我略略地写了这信，托我所看为忠心的兄弟西拉转交你们，劝勉你们，又证明这恩是　神的真恩。你们务要在这恩上站立得住。


彼前5:13
> She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you her greetings, and so does my son Mark.
>
> 在巴比伦与你们同蒙拣选的教会问你们安。我儿子马可也问你们安。


彼前5:14
> Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
>
> 你们要用爱心彼此亲嘴问安。愿平安归与你们凡在基督里的人。
