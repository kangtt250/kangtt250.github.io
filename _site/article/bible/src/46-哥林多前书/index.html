another, “I follow Apollos”; another, “I follow Cephas”; still another, “I follow Christ.”<p>我的意思就是你们各人说：“我是属保罗的”，“我是属亚波罗的”，“我是属矶法的”，“我是属基督的”。</blockquote><p>林前1:13<blockquote><p>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized into the name of Paul?<p>基督是分开的吗？保罗为你们钉了十字架吗？你们是奉保罗的名受了洗吗？</blockquote><p>林前1:14<blockquote><p>I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,<p>我感谢　神，除了基利司布并该犹以外，我没有给你们一个人施洗，</blockquote><p>林前1:15<blockquote><p>so no one can say that you were baptized into my name.<p>免得有人说，你们是奉我的名受洗。</blockquote><p>林前1:16<blockquote><p>(Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don’t remember if I baptized anyone else.)<p>我也给司提反家施过洗，此外给别人施洗没有，我却记不清。</blockquote><p>林前1:17<blockquote><p>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel–not with words of human wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.<p>基督差遣我，原不是为施洗，乃是为传福音，并不用智慧的言语，免得基督的十字架落了空。</blockquote><p>林前1:18<blockquote><p>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.<p>因为十字架的道理，在那灭亡的人为愚拙；在我们得救的人却为　神的大能。</blockquote><p>林前1:19<blockquote><p>For it is written: “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.”<p>就如经上所记：“我要灭绝智慧人的智慧，废弃聪明人的聪明。”</blockquote><p>林前1:20<blockquote><p>Where is the wise man? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?<p>智慧人在哪里？文士在哪里？这世上的辩士在哪里？　神岂不是叫这世上的智慧变成愚拙吗？</blockquote><p>林前1:21<blockquote><p>For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.<p>世人凭自己的智慧，既不认识　神，　神就乐意用人所当作愚拙的道理拯救那些信的人，这就是　神的智慧了。</blockquote><p>林前1:22<blockquote><p>Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom,<p>犹太人是要神迹，希利尼人是求智慧；</blockquote><p>林前1:23<blockquote><p>but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,<p>我们却是传钉十字架的基督。在犹太人为绊脚石，在外邦人为愚拙；</blockquote><p>林前1:24<blockquote><p>but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.<p>但在那蒙召的，无论是犹太人、希利尼人，基督总为　神的能力，　神的智慧。</blockquote><p>林前1:25<blockquote><p>For the foolishness of God is wiser than man’s wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man’s strength.<p>因　神的愚拙总比人智慧，　神的软弱总比人强壮。</blockquote><p>林前1:26<blockquote><p>Brothers, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth.<p>弟兄们哪，可见你们蒙召的，按着肉体有智慧的不多，有能力的不多，有尊贵的也不多。</blockquote><p>林前1:27<blockquote><p>But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.<p>神却拣选了世上愚拙的，叫有智慧的羞愧；又拣选了世上软弱的，叫那强壮的羞愧。</blockquote><p>林前1:28<blockquote><p>He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things–and the things that are not–to nullify the things that are,<p>神也拣选了世上卑贱的，被人厌恶的，以及那无有的，为要废掉那有的，</blockquote><p>林前1:29<blockquote><p>so that no one may boast before him.<p>使一切有血气的，在　神面前一个也不能自夸。</blockquote><p>林前1:30<blockquote><p>It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God–that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption.<p>但你们得在基督耶稣里是本乎　神，　神又使他成为我们的智慧、公义、圣洁、救赎。</blockquote><p>林前1:31<blockquote><p>Therefore, as it is written: “Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.”<p>如经上所记：“夸口的，当指着主夸口。”</blockquote><h2 id="哥林多前书第2章">哥林多前书第2章</h2><p>林前2:1<blockquote><p>When I came to you, brothers, I did not come with eloquence or superior wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God.<p>弟兄们，从前我到你们那里去，并没有用高言大智对你们宣传　神的奥秘。</blockquote><p>林前2:2<blockquote><p>For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.<p>因为我曾定了主意，在你们中间不知道别的，只知道耶稣基督并他钉十字架。</blockquote><p>林前2:3<blockquote><p>I came to you in weakness and fear, and with much trembling.<p>我在你们那里，又软弱，又惧怕，又甚战兢。</blockquote><p>林前2:4<blockquote><p>My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit’s power,<p>我说的话，讲的道，不是用智慧委婉的言语，乃是用圣灵和大能的明证，</blockquote><p>林前2:5<blockquote><p>so that your faith might not rest on men’s wisdom, but on God’s power.<p>叫你们的信不在乎人的智慧，只在乎　神的大能。</blockquote><p>林前2:6<blockquote><p>We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.<p>然而，在完全的人中，我们也讲智慧。但不是这世上的智慧，也不是这世上有权有位将要败亡之人的智慧。</blockquote><p>林前2:7<blockquote><p>No, we speak of God’s secret wisdom, a wisdom that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began.<p>我们讲的，乃是从前所隐藏、　神奥秘的智慧，就是　神在万世以前预定使我们得荣耀的。</blockquote><p>林前2:8<blockquote><p>None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.<p>这智慧，世上有权有位的人没有一个知道的；他们若知道，就不把荣耀的主钉在十字架上了。</blockquote><p>林前2:9<blockquote><p>However, as it is written: “No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him”–<p>如经上所记：“　神为爱他的人所预备的，是眼睛未曾看见，耳朵未曾听见，人心也未曾想到的。”</blockquote><p>林前2:10<blockquote><p>but God has revealed it to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.<p>只有　神藉着圣灵向我们显明了，因为圣灵参透万事，就是　神深奥的事也参透了。</blockquote><p>林前2:11<blockquote><p>For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man’s spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.<p>除了在人里头的灵，谁知道人的事？像这样，除了　神的灵，也没有人知道　神的事。</blockquote><p>林前2:12<blockquote><p>We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us.<p>我们所领受的，并不是世上的灵，乃是从　神来的灵，叫我们能知道　神开恩赐给我们的事。</blockquote><p>林前2:13<blockquote><p>This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words.<p>并且我们讲说这些事，不是用人智慧所指教的言语，乃是用圣灵所指教的言语，将属灵的话解释属灵的事（或作“将属灵的事讲与属灵的人”）。</blockquote><p>林前2:14<blockquote><p>The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.<p>然而，属血气的人不领会　神圣灵的事，反倒以为愚拙，并且不能知道，因为这些事惟有属灵的人才能看透。</blockquote><p>林前2:15<blockquote><p>The spiritual man makes judgments about all things, but he himself is not subject to any man’s judgment:<p>属灵的人能看透万事，却没有一人能看透了他。</blockquote><p>林前2:16<blockquote><p>“For who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him?” But we have the mind of Christ.<p>“谁曾知道主的心去教导他呢？”但我们是有基督的心了。</blockquote><h2 id="哥林多前书第3章">哥林多前书第3章</h2><p>林前3:1<blockquote><p>Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual but as worldly–mere infants in Christ.<p>弟兄们，我从前对你们说话，不能把你们当作属灵的，只得把你们当作属肉体，在基督里为婴孩的。</blockquote><p>林前3:2<blockquote><p>I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready.<p>我是用奶喂你们，没有用饭喂你们。那时你们不能吃，就是如今还是不能。</blockquote><p>林前3:3<blockquote><p>You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere men?<p>你们仍是属肉体的。因为在你们中间有嫉妒分争，这岂不是属乎肉体，照着世人的样子行吗？</blockquote><p>林前3:4<blockquote><p>For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not mere men?<p>有说：“我是属保罗的。”有说：“我是属亚波罗的。”这岂不是你们和世人一样吗？</blockquote><p>林前3:5<blockquote><p>What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe–as the Lord has assigned to each his task.<p>亚波罗算什么？保罗算什么？无非是执事，照主所赐给他们各人的，引导你们相信。</blockquote><p>林前3:6<blockquote><p>I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.<p>我栽种了，亚波罗浇灌了，惟有　神叫他生长。</blockquote><p>林前3:7<blockquote><p>So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.<p>可见栽种的算不得什么，浇灌的也算不得什么，只在那叫他生长的　神。</blockquote><p>林前3:8<blockquote><p>The man who plants and the man who waters have one purpose, and each will be rewarded according to his own labor.<p>栽种的和浇灌的，都是一样。但将来各人要照自己的工夫得自己的赏赐。</blockquote><p>林前3:9<blockquote><p>For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.<p>因为我们是与　神同工的；你们是　神所耕种的田地，所建造的房屋。</blockquote><p>林前3:10<blockquote><p>By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should be careful how he builds.<p>我照　神所给我的恩，好像一个聪明的工头，立好了根基，有别人在上面建造，只是各人要谨慎怎样在上面建造。</blockquote><p>林前3:11<blockquote><p>For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.<p>因为那已经立好的根基就是耶稣基督，此外没有人能立别的根基。</blockquote><p>林前3:12<blockquote><p>If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw,<p>若有人用金、银、宝石、草木、禾秸在这根基上建造，</blockquote><p>林前3:13<blockquote><p>his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man’s work.<p>各人的工程必然显露，因为那日子要将它表明出来，有火发现，这火要试验各人的工程怎样。</blockquote><p>林前3:14<blockquote><p>If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward.<p>人在那根基上所建造的工程若存得住，他就要得赏赐；</blockquote><p>林前3:15<blockquote><p>If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames.<p>人的工程若被烧了，他就要受亏损，自己却要得救；虽然得救，乃像从火里经过的一样。</blockquote><p>林前3:16<blockquote><p>Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit lives in you?<p>岂不知你们是　神的殿，　神的灵住在你们里头吗？</blockquote><p>林前3:17<blockquote><p>If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is sacred, and you are that temple.<p>若有人毁坏　神的殿，　神必要毁坏那人，因为　神的殿是圣的，这殿就是你们。</blockquote><p>林前3:18<blockquote><p>Do not deceive yourselves. If any one of you thinks he is wise by the standards of this age, he should become a “fool” so that he may become wise.<p>人不可自欺。你们中间若有人在这世界自以为有智慧，倒不如变作愚拙，好成为有智慧的。</blockquote><p>林前3:19<blockquote><p>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness”;<p>因这世界的智慧，在　神看是愚拙。如经上记着说：“主叫有智慧的，中了自己的诡计。”</blockquote><p>林前3:20<blockquote><p>and again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.”<p>又说：“主知道智慧人的意念是虚妄的。”</blockquote><p>林前3:21<blockquote><p>So then, no more boasting about men! All things are yours,<p>所以无论谁，都不可拿人夸口，因为万有全是你们的。</blockquote><p>林前3:22<blockquote><p>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future–all are yours,<p>或保罗，或亚波罗，或矶法，或世界，或生，或死，或现今的事，或将来的事，全是你们的。</blockquote><p>林前3:23<blockquote><p>and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.<p>并且你们是属基督的，基督又是属　神的。</blockquote><h2 id="哥林多前书第4章">哥林多前书第4章</h2><p>林前4:1<blockquote><p>So then, men ought to regard us as servants of Christ and as those entrusted with the secret things of God.<p>人应当以我们为基督的执事，为　神奥秘事的管家。</blockquote><p>林前4:2<blockquote><p>Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful.<p>所求于管家的，是要他有忠心。</blockquote><p>林前4:3<blockquote><p>I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself.<p>我被你们论断，或被别人论断，我都以为极小的事，连我自己也不论断自己。</blockquote><p>林前4:4<blockquote><p>My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent.
