#  Meditation + Mental Strength
冥想+精神力量
An emotion is our evolved biology predicting the future impact of a current event. In modern settings, it’s usually exaggerated or wrong.

情绪是我们进化的生物学，预测当前事件的未来影响。在现代环境中，这通常是夸张的或错误的。

Why is meditation so powerful?

为什么冥想如此强大？

Your breath is one of the few places where your autonomic nervous system meets your voluntary nervous system. It’s involuntary, but you can also control it.

你的呼吸是你的自主神经系统与你的自主神经系统相遇的少数几个地方之一。这是非自愿的，但你也可以控制它。

I think a lot of meditation practices put an emphasis on the breath because it is a gateway into your autonomic nervous system. There are many, many cases in the medical and spiritual literature of people controlling their bodies at levels that should be autonomous.

我认为很多冥想练习都把重点放在呼吸上，因为它是进入你自主神经系统的门户。在医学和精神文献中，人们在应该自主的水平上控制自己的身体的情况很多，很多。

Your mind is such a powerful thing. What’s so unusual about your forebrain sending signals to your hindbrain and your hindbrain routing resources to your entire body?

你的头脑是如此强大的东西。你的前脑向你的后脑发送信号，而你的后脑将资源传递到你的整个身体，这有什么不寻常的呢？
You can do it just by breathing. Relaxed breathing tells your body you’re safe. Then, your forebrain doesn’t need as many resources as it normally does. Now, the extra energy can be sent to your hindbrain, and it can reroute those resources to the rest of your body.

你只要呼吸就可以做到。放松的呼吸告诉你的身体你是安全的。这样一来，你的前脑就不需要像平常那样多的资源了。现在，额外的能量可以被发送到你的后脑，它可以将这些资源重新分配到你身体的其他部位。

I’m not saying you can beat whatever illness you have just because you activated your hindbrain. But you’re devoting most of the energy normally required to care about the external environment to the immune system.

我并不是说，仅仅因为你激活了你的后脑，你就可以战胜你所患的任何疾病。但你把通常关心外部环境所需的大部分精力都投入到了免疫系统中。

I highly recommend listening to the Tim Ferriss’s podcast with Wim Hof. He is a walking miracle. Wim’s nickname is the Ice Man. He holds the world record for the longest time spent in an ice bath and swimming in freezing cold water. I was very inspired by him, not only because he’s capable of super -human physical feats, but because he does it while being incredibly kind and happy—which is not easy to accomplish.

我强烈推荐你和Wim Hof一起收听Tim Ferriss的播客。他是一个活着的奇迹。维姆的昵称是“冰人”。他保持着在冰浴和冰冷的水中游泳的时间最长的世界纪录。他给了我很大的启发，不仅是因为他有能力做出超人的身体壮举，还因为他做到了这一点，而且他非常善良和快乐-这是不容易实现的。

He advocates cold exposure, because he believes people are too separate from their natural environment. We’re constantly clothed, fed, and warm. Our bodies have lost touch with the cold. The cold is important because it can activate the immune system.

他提倡寒冷暴露，因为他认为人们与自然环境过于隔绝。我们经常穿衣、吃东西，而且很暖和。我们的身体已经与寒冷失去了联系。感冒很重要，因为它可以激活免疫系统。

So, he advocates taking long ice baths. Being from the Indian subcontinent, I’m strongly against the idea of ice baths. But Wim inspired me to give cold showers a try. And I did so by using the Wim Hof breathing method. It involves hyperventilating to get more oxygen into your blood, which raises your core temperature. Then, you can go into the shower.

因此，他主张进行长时间的冰浴。作为印度次大陆人，我强烈反对冰浴的想法。但是维姆激励我试着洗冷水澡。我使用Wim Hof呼吸法做到了这一点。它包括过度换气，以获得更多的氧气进入你的血液，从而提高你的核心温度。然后，你就可以去洗澡了。

The first few cold showers were hilarious because I’d slowly ease myself in, wincing the entire way. I started about four or five months ago. Now, I turn the shower on full -blast , and then I walk right in. I don’t give myself any time to hesitate. As soon as I hear the voice in my head telling me how cold it’s going to be, I know I have to walk in.

最初的几个冷水澡很好笑，因为我会慢慢放松自己，一路上都在退缩。我大约四五个月前开始工作。现在，我把淋浴开到最大，然后我径直走进去。我没有给自己任何时间犹豫。当我听到脑海中的声音告诉我天气会有多冷时，我知道我必须走进去。

I learned a very important lesson from this: most of our suffering comes from avoidance. Most of the suffering from a cold shower is the tip -toeing your way in. Once you’re in, you’re in. It’s not suffering. It’s just cold. Your body saying it’s cold is different than your mind saying it’s cold. Acknowledge your body saying it’s cold. Look at it. Deal with it. Accept it, but don’t mentally suffer over it. Taking a cold shower for two minutes isn’t going to kill you.

我从中学到了一个非常重要的教训：我们的大部分痛苦都来自逃避。洗冷水澡的大部分痛苦都是脚尖着地走进去的。一旦你进去了，你就进去了。这不是痛苦。只是太冷了。你的身体说冷和你的心说冷是不同的。承认你的身体说它很冷。快看啊。处理它。接受它，但不要为它而精神痛苦。洗两分钟冷水澡不会要了你的命。

Having a cold shower helps you re -learn that lesson every morning. Now hot showers are just one less thing I need out of life. [2]

每天早上洗个冷水澡可以帮助你重新学习这一课。现在热水澡只是我生活中少了一件需要的东西。

Meditation is intermittent fasting for the mind.

冥想是头脑间歇性的禁食。

Too much sugar leads to a heavy body, and too many distractions lead to a heavy mind.

过多的糖分会导致沉重的身体，过多的分心会导致沉重的思想。

Time spent undistracted and alone, in self -examination , journaling, meditation, resolves the unresolved and takes us from mentally fat to fit.

在自我反省、写日记、冥想中，花些时间心不在焉地独处，可以解决悬而未决的问题，让我们从精神上变得健康。

Do you have a current meditation practice?

你现在有冥想练习吗？
I think meditation is like dieting, where everyone is supposedly following a regimen. Everyone says they do it, but nobody actually does it. The real set of people who meditate on a regular basis, I’ve found, are pretty rare. I’ve identified and tried at least four different forms of meditation.

我认为冥想就像节食，每个人都应该遵循一个养生法。每个人都说他们这么做了，但实际上没有人这么做。我发现，真正有规律地冥想的人是相当罕见的。我已经确认并尝试了至少四种不同形式的冥想。

The one I found works best for me is called Choiceless Awareness, or Nonjudgmental Awareness. As you’re going about your daily business (hopefully, there’s some nature) and you’re not talking to anybody else, you practice learning to accept the moment you’re in without making judgments. You don’t think, “Oh, there’s a homeless guy over there, better cross the street” or look at someone running by and say, “He’s out of shape, and I’m in better shape than him.”

我发现最适合我的是“无选择意识”，或“非评判意识”。当你在处理你的日常事务时(希望是有某种性质的)，你不会和其他任何人说话，你在练习接受你所处的时刻，而不是做出判断。你不会想，“哦，那边有个流浪汉，最好过马路”，或者看着路过的人说，“他身材不好，我的身材比他好。”

If I saw a guy with a bad hair day, I would at first think “Haha, he has a bad hair day.” Well, why am I laughing at him to make me feel better about myself? And why am I trying to make me feel better about my own hair? Because I’m losing my hair, and I’m afraid it’s going to go away. What I find is 90 percent of thoughts I have are fear -based . The other 10 percent may be desire -based .

如果我一天看到一个头发不好的家伙，我会首先想到“哈哈，他今天头发不好。”我为什么要嘲笑他来让我自我感觉好一点呢？为什么我要试着让自己对自己的头发感觉好一点呢？因为我的头发要掉了，我担心它会消失。我发现我90%的想法都是基于恐惧。另外10%可能是基于欲望。

You don’t make any decisions. You don’t judge anything. You just accept everything. If I do that for ten or fifteen minutes while walking around, I end up in a very peaceful, grateful state. Choiceless Awareness works well for me. [6]

你不能做任何决定。你不会评判任何事情。你只要接受一切就行了。如果我在四处走动时这样做10到15分钟，我最终会处于一种非常平静和感激的状态。没有选择的意识对我很有效。

You could also do transcendental meditation, which is where you’re using repetitive chanting to create a white noise in your head to bury your thoughts. Or, you can just very keenly and very alertly be aware of your thoughts as they happen. As you watch your thoughts, you realize how many of them are fear -based . The moment you recognize a fear, without even trying it goes away. After a while, your mind quiets.

你也可以做超然的冥想，在那里你用重复的吟诵在你的脑海里制造白噪音来掩埋你的思想。或者，当你的想法发生时，你可以非常敏锐和警觉地意识到它们。当你观察自己的想法时，你会意识到其中有多少是基于恐惧的。当你意识到一种恐惧的那一刻，甚至没有尝试它就会消失。过了一会儿，你的头脑就会平静下来。

When your mind quiets, you stop taking everything around you for granted. You start to notice the details. You think, “Wow, I live in such a beautiful place. It’s so great that I have clothes, and I can go to Starbucks and get a coffee anytime. Look at these people—each one has a perfectly valid and complete life going on in their own heads.”

当你的头脑平静下来时，你就不再认为你周围的一切都是理所当然的。你开始注意到细节。你会想，“哇，我住在这么漂亮的地方。我有衣服真是太棒了，而且我可以随时去星巴克喝杯咖啡。看看这些人--每个人的头脑里都有一个完美而完整的生活。“
It pops us out of the story we’re constantly telling ourselves. If you stop talking to yourself for even ten minutes, if you stop obsessing over your own story, you’ll realize we are really far up Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, and life is pretty good. [6]

它把我们从我们不断告诉自己的故事中解脱出来。如果你停止自言自语，哪怕只有10分钟，如果你不再纠结于自己的故事，你就会意识到，我们真的远远超出了马斯洛的需求层次，生活是相当美好的。

Life -hack : When in bed, meditate. Either you will have a deep meditation or fall asleep. Victory either way.

生活黑客：躺在床上冥想。你要么会沉思，要么就会睡着。不管是哪种方式的胜利。

Another method I’ve learned is to just sit there and you close your eyes for at least one hour a day. You surrender to whatever happens—don’t make any effort whatsoever. You make no effort for something, and you make no effort against anything. If there are thoughts running through your mind, you let the thoughts run.

我学到的另一种方法就是坐在那里，每天闭上眼睛至少一个小时。无论发生什么，你都要投降--无论如何都不要做任何努力。你不为某事努力，也不为任何事努力。如果有想法在你的脑海中运行，你就让这些想法运行。

For your entire life, things have been happening to you. Some good, some bad, most of which you have processed and dissolved, but a few stuck with you. Over time, more and more stuck with you, and they almost became like these barnacles stuck to you.

在你的一生中，事情一直发生在你身上。有些是好的，有些是坏的，大部分你已经处理并溶解了，但也有一些粘在了你身上。随着时间的推移，越来越多的人粘在你身上，它们几乎就像这些藤壶粘在你身上一样。

You lost your childhood sense of wonder and of being present and happy. You lost your inner happiness because you built up this personality of unresolved pain, errors, fears, and desires that glommed onto you like a bunch of barnacles.

你失去了童年时的好奇心，失去了活在当下和快乐的感觉。你失去了内心的快乐，因为你建立了这种未解决的痛苦、错误、恐惧和欲望的人格，就像一群藤壶一样压在你身上。

How do you get those barnacles off you? What happens in meditation is you’re sitting there and not resisting your mind. These things will start bubbling up. It’s like a giant inbox of unanswered emails, going back to your childhood. They will come out one by one, and you will be forced to deal with them.

你是怎么把那些藤壶弄下来的？冥想中发生的事情是你坐在那里，而不是抗拒你的思想。这些东西会开始冒泡。它就像一个巨大的收件箱，里面装满了未回复的电子邮件，回到了你的童年。他们会一个接一个地出来，你将被迫与他们打交道。

You will be forced to resolve them. Resolving them doesn’t take any work—you just observe them. Now you’re an adult with some distance, time, and space from previous events, and you can just resolve them. You can be much more objective about how you view them.

你将被迫解决这些问题。解决它们不需要任何工作-您只需观察它们。现在你是成年人了，与以前的事件有一定的距离、时间和空间，你可以直接解决它们。你可以更加客观地看待它们。

Over time, you will resolve a lot of these deep -seated unresolved things you have in your mind. Once they’re resolved, there will come a day when you sit down to meditate, and you’ll hit a mental “inbox zero.” When you open your mental “email” and there are none, that is a pretty amazing feeling.

随着时间的推移，你会解决很多你脑海中这些深层次的悬而未决的事情。一旦这些问题得到解决，总有一天你会坐下来冥想，然后你的脑海中就会出现“收件箱为零”的情况。当你打开你脑海中的“电子邮件”，却什么也没有，那是一种非常令人惊奇的感觉。

It’s a state of joy and bliss and peace. Once you have it, you don’t want to give it up. If you can get a free hour of bliss every morning just by sitting and closing your eyes, that is worth its weight in gold. It will change your life.

这是一种欢乐、幸福和和平的状态。一旦你拥有了它，你就不会想放弃它。如果你每天早上只需坐着闭上眼睛就能得到一小时的空闲时间，那就是价值不菲的黄金。它会改变你的生活。

I recommend meditating one hour each morning because anything less is not enough time to really get deep into it. I would recommend if you really want to try meditation, try sixty days of one hour a day, first thing in the morning. After about sixty days, you will be tired of listening to your own mind. You will have resolved a lot of issues, or you have heard them enough to see through those fears and issues.

我建议每天早上冥想一个小时，因为任何少一点的时间都不足以真正深入冥想。如果你真的想尝试冥想，我建议你尝试六十天，每天一小时，早上第一件事。大约六十天后，你会厌倦倾听自己的想法。你将已经解决了很多问题，或者你已经听到了足够多的东西来看穿那些恐惧和问题。

Meditation isn’t hard. All you have to do is sit there and do nothing. Just sit down. Close your eyes and say, “I’m just going to give myself a break for an hour. This is my hour off from life. This is the hour I’m not going to do anything.

冥想并不难。你所要做的就是坐在那里什么也不做。坐下来就行了。闭上眼睛说，“我要让自己休息一个小时。这是我离开生活的一小时。现在是我什么都不会做的时候了。

“If thoughts come, thoughts come. I’m not going to fight them. I’m not going to embrace them. I’m not going to think harder about them. I’m not going to reject them. I’m just going to sit here for an hour with my eyes closed, and I’m going to do nothing.” How hard is that? Why can you not do anything for an hour? What’s so hard about giving yourself an hour -long break? [74]

“如果思想来了，思想就来了。我不会和他们战斗的。我不会拥抱他们的。我不会再多想他们了。我不会拒绝他们的。我就在这里闭着眼睛坐一个小时，什么也不做。“这有多难？你为什么一个小时都不能做点什么呢？给自己一个小时的休息有什么难的？[74]

Was there a moment you realized you could control how you interpreted things? I think one problem people have is not recognizing they can control how they interpret and respond to a situation.

有没有那么一刻，你意识到你可以控制自己对事物的解读？我认为人们存在的一个问题是没有认识到他们可以控制自己如何解释和应对一种情况。

I think everyone knows it’s possible. There’s a great Osho lecture, titled “The Attraction for Drugs Is Spiritual.” He talks about why do people do drugs (everything from alcohol to psychedelics to cannabis). They’re doing it to control their mental state. They’re doing it to control how they react. Some people drink because it helps them not care as much, or they’re potheads because they can zone out, or they do psychedelics to feel very present or connected to nature. The attraction of drugs is spiritual.

我想每个人都知道这是可能的。有一个很棒的Osho讲座，题目是“毒品的吸引力是精神的。”他谈到人们为什么吸毒(从酒精到迷幻剂再到大麻)。他们这样做是为了控制自己的精神状态。他们这么做是为了控制自己的反应。有些人喝酒是因为这可以帮助他们不那么在意，或者他们是瘾君子因为他们可以神志不清，或者他们做迷幻剂是为了感觉到非常在场或与自然联系在一起。毒品的吸引力是精神上的。

All of society does this to some extent. People chasing thrills in action sports or flow states or orgasms—any of these states people strive for are people trying to get out of their own heads. They’re trying to get away from the voice in their heads—the overdeveloped sense of self.

所有的社会都在某种程度上做到了这一点。人们在动作、运动、心流状态或高潮中追逐刺激--人们所追求的这些状态中的任何一种都是试图跳出自己的头脑的人。他们试图摆脱头脑中的声音--过度发展的自我意识。

At the very least, I do not want my sense of self to continue to develop and strengthen as I get older. I want it to be weaker and more muted so I can be more in present everyday reality, accept nature and the world for what it is, and appreciate it very much as a child would. [4]

至少，我不想让我的自我意识随着年龄的增长而继续发展和加强。我想要它变得更弱、更安静，这样我就可以更多地处于现在的日常现实中，接受自然和世界的本来面目，像孩子一样欣赏它。

The first thing to realize is you can observe your mental state. Meditation doesn’t mean you’re suddenly going to gain the superpower to control your internal state. The advantage of meditation is recognizing just how out of control your mind is. It is like a monkey flinging feces, running around the room, making trouble, shouting, and breaking things. It’s completely uncontrollable. It’s an out -of -control madperson.

首先要意识到的是，你可以观察自己的精神状态。冥想并不意味着你会突然获得控制内心状态的超能力。冥想的好处是认识到你的思想是多么的失控。它就像一只猴子扔粪便，在房间里跑来跑去，捣乱，叫喊，打碎东西。这是完全无法控制的。这是个失控的疯子。

You have to see this mad creature in operation before you feel a certain distaste toward it and start separating yourself from it. In that separation is liberation. You realize, “Oh, I don’t want to be that person. Why am I so out of control?” Awareness alone calms you down. [4]

你必须看到这个疯狂的生物在运作，然后你才会对它产生某种反感，并开始与它分离。在这种分离中，就是解放。你会意识到，“哦，我不想成为那样的人。为什么我会这么失控？“意识本身就能让你平静下来。

Insight meditation lets you run your brain in debug mode until you realize you’re just a subroutine in a larger program.

洞察力冥想让你在调试模式下运行你的大脑，直到你意识到你只是一个更大程序中的一个子例程。

I try to keep an eye on my internal monologue. It doesn’t always work. In the computer programming sense, I try to run my brain in “debugging mode” as much as possible. When I’m talking to someone, or when I’m engaged in a group activity, it’s almost impossible because your brain has too many things to handle. If I’m by myself, like just this morning, I’m brushing my teeth and I start thinking forward to a podcast. I started going through this little fantasy where I imagined Shane asking me a bunch of questions and I was fantasy - answering them. Then, I caught myself. I put my brain in debug mode and just watched every little instruction go by.

我试着注意我内心的独白。它并不总是有效的。在计算机编程的意义上，我尽量让我的大脑运行在“调试模式”中。当我和某人交谈时，或者当我参与小组活动时，这几乎是不可能的，因为你的大脑有太多的事情要处理。如果我一个人，就像今天早上一样，我在刷牙，我开始想着播客。我开始经历这个小小的幻想，我想象谢恩问了我一堆问题，我幻想着回答这些问题。然后，我突然发现自己。我把我的大脑置于调试模式，只是看着每一条小指令流逝。

I said, “Why am I fantasy -future planning? Why can’t I just stand here and brush my teeth?” It’s the awareness my brain was running off in the future and planning some fantasy scenario out of ego. I was like, “Well, do I really care if I embarrass myself? Who cares? I’m going to die anyway. This is all going to go to zero, and I won’t remember anything, so this is pointless.”


我说，“我为什么要幻想未来的计划？为什么我不能站在这里刷牙呢？“这是一种意识，我的大脑在未来失去了知觉，出于自我而计划着一些幻想的场景。我就想，“好吧，我真的在乎我会不会让自己难堪？谁在乎啊？反正我都要死了。这一切都会归零，我什么都不会记得，所以这是毫无意义的。“

Then, I shut down, and I went back to brushing my teeth. I was noticing how good the toothbrush was and how good it felt. Then the next moment, I’m off to thinking something else. I have to look at my brain again and say, “Do I really need to solve this problem right now?”


然后，我就关机了，我又回去刷牙了。我注意到牙刷有多好，手感也有多好。然后下一刻，我就开始想别的事情了。我不得不再看一
眼我的大脑，然后说，“我真的需要现在就解决这个问题吗？”


Ninety -five percent of what my brain runs off and tries to do, I don’t need to tackle in that exact moment. If the brain is like a muscle, I’ll be better off resting it, being at peace. When a particular problem arises, I’ll immerse myself in it.

我大脑中95%的事情都在流逝并试图去做，我不需要在那个时刻去处理。如果大脑像一块肌肉，我最好让它休息，平静下来。当一个特别的问题出现时，我会全身心地投入其中。

Right now as we’re talking, I’d rather dedicate myself to being completely lost in the conversation and to being 100 percent focused on this as opposed to thinking about “Oh, when I brushed my teeth, did I do it the right way?”

现在我们谈话的时候，我宁愿完全沉浸在谈话中，百分之百地专注于这件事，而不是想“哦，当我刷牙的时候，我做得对吗？”

The ability to singularly focus is related to the ability to lose yourself and be present, happy, and (ironically) more effective. [4]

集中注意力的能力与迷失自我、活在当下、快乐和(具有讽刺意味的)更有效率的能力有关。

It’s almost like you’re taking yourself out of a certain frame and you’re watching things from a different perspective even though you’re in your own mind.

这几乎就像是你把自己从某个特定的画面中带出来，你从一个不同的角度看事情，即使你在你自己的头脑里。

Buddhists talk about awareness versus the ego. They’re really talking about how you can think of your brain, your consciousness, as a multilayered mechanism. There’s a core -base , kernel -level OS running. Then, there are applications running on top. (I like to think of it as computer and geek speak.)
佛教徒谈论觉知与自我。他们实际上是在谈论如何将你的大脑、你的意识看作一个多层次的机制。有一个基于内核的内核级操作系统在运行。然后，有一些应用程序在上面运行。(我喜欢把它想象成电脑和极客的语言。)
I’m actually going back to my awareness level of OS, which is always calm, always peaceful, and generally happy and content. I’m trying to stay in awareness mode and not activate the monkey mind, which is always worried, frightened, and anxious. It serves incredible purpose, but I try not to activate the monkey mind until I need it. When I need it, I want to just focus on that. If I run it 24/7, I waste energy and the monkey mind becomes me. I am more than my monkey mind.

我实际上是回到了我对操作系统的认知水平，它总是平静的，总是和平的，总体上是快乐和满足的。我试着保持清醒状态，而不是激活猴子的思维，它总是担心、害怕和焦虑。它有令人难以置信的目的，但我试着不激活猴子的大脑，直到我需要它。当我需要它的时候，我只想专注于它。如果我全天候运行它，我就浪费了能量，猴子的头脑就变成了我。我不仅仅是我的猴心。

Another thing: spirituality, religion, Buddhism, or anything you follow will teach you over time you are more than just your mind. You are more than just your habits. You are more than just your preferences. You’re a level of awareness. You’re a body. Modern humans, we don’t live enough in our bodies. We don’t live enough in our awareness. We live too much in this internal monologue in our heads. All of which is just programmed into you by society and by the environment when you were younger.

另一件事：灵性、宗教、佛教或你遵循的任何东西，随着时间的推移会教会你，你不仅仅是你的头脑。你不仅仅是你的习惯。你不仅仅是你的喜好。你是某种程度的意识。你是一具身体。现代人，我们在我们的身体里活得不够。我们在意识中活得不够。我们在头脑中的这种内心独白中活得太多了。当你年轻的时候，所有这些都是社会和环境编入你体内的。

You are basically a bunch of DNA that reacted to environmental effects when you were younger. You recorded the good and bad experiences, and you use them to prejudge everything thrown against you. Then you’re using those experiences, constantly trying and predict and change the future.

你基本上是一群在你年轻时对环境影响做出反应的DNA。你记录下了好的和不好的经历，并用它们来预判任何对你不利的事情。然后你就会利用这些经验，不断地尝试、预测和改变未来。

As you get older, the sum of preferences you’ve accumulated is very, very large. These habitual reactions end up as runaway freight trains controlling your mood. We should control our own moods. Why don’t we study how to control our moods? What a masterful thing it would be if you could say, “Right now I would like to be in the curious state,” and then you can genuinely get yourself into the curious state. Or say, “I want to be in a mourning state. I’m mourning a loved one, and I want to grieve for them. I really want to feel that. I don’t want to be distracted by a computer programming problem due tomorrow.”

随着年龄的增长，你积累的偏好总和会非常非常大。这些习惯性反应最终会变成失控的货运列车控制你的情绪。我们应该控制自己的情绪。我们为什么不研究一下如何控制自己的情绪呢？如果你能说，“现在我想要处于好奇的状态”，然后你就能真正地让自己进入好奇的状态，那将是一件多么高超的事情。或者说，“我想处于哀悼状态。我在哀悼我所爱的人，我想为他们哀悼。我真的很想感受一下。我不想因为明天要出的电脑编程问题而分心。“

The mind itself is a muscle—it can be trained and conditioned. It has been haphazardly conditioned by society to be out of our control. If you look at your mind with awareness and intent (a 24/7 job you’re working at every moment) I think you can unpack your own mind, your emotions, thoughts, and reactions. Then you can start reconfiguring. You can start rewriting this program to what you want. [4]

头脑本身就是一块肌肉--它可以被训练和调节。它已经被社会随意地规定为不受我们的控制。如果你用意识和意图来看待你的头脑(一份24/7全天候的工作，你每时每刻都在工作)，我认为你可以解开你自己的头脑，你的情绪，你的想法，和你的反应。然后您可以开始重新配置。您可以开始将此程序重写为您想要的内容。
