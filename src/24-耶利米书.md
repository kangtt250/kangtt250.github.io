> Then the word of the LORD came to me:
>
> 耶和华的话又临到我说：


耶16:2
> "You must not marry and have sons or daughters in this place."
>
> “你在这地方不可娶妻生儿养女。”


耶16:3
> For this is what the LORD says about the sons and daughters born in this land and about the women who are their mothers and the men who are their fathers:
>
> 因为论到在这地方所生的儿女，又论到在这国中生养他们的父母，耶和华如此说：


耶16:4
> "They will die of deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried but will be like refuse lying on the ground. They will perish by sword and famine, and their dead bodies will become food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth."
>
> “他们必死得甚苦，无人哀哭，必不得葬埋；必在地上像粪土，必被刀剑和饥荒灭绝；他们的尸首必给空中的飞鸟和地上的野兽作食物。”


耶16:5
> For this is what the LORD says: "Do not enter a house where there is a funeral meal; do not go to mourn or show sympathy, because I have withdrawn my blessing, my love and my pity from this people," declares the LORD.
>
> 耶和华如此说：“不要进入丧家，不要去哀哭，也不要为他们悲伤，因我已将我的平安、慈爱、怜悯从这百姓夺去了。”这是耶和华说的。


耶16:6
> "Both high and low will die in this land. They will not be buried or mourned, and no one will cut himself or shave his head for them.
>
> “连大带小，都必在这地死亡，不得葬埋。人必不为他们哀哭，不用刀划身，也不使头光秃。


耶16:7
> No one will offer food to comfort those who mourn for the dead--not even for a father or a mother--nor will anyone give them a drink to console them.
>
> 他们有丧事，人必不为他们擘饼，因死人安慰他们。他们丧父丧母，人也不给他们一杯酒安慰他们。


耶16:8
> "And do not enter a house where there is feasting and sit down to eat and drink.
>
> 你不可进入宴乐的家，与他们同坐吃喝。


耶16:9
> For this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Before your eyes and in your days I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in this place.
>
> 因为万军之耶和华以色列的　神如此说：你们还活着的日子在你们眼前，我必使欢喜和快乐的声音、新郎和新妇的声音从这地方止息了。


耶16:10
> "When you tell these people all this and they ask you, 'Why has the LORD decreed such a great disaster against us? What wrong have we done? What sin have we committed against the LORD our God?'
>
> 你将这一切的话指示这百姓，他们问你说：‘耶和华为什么说，要降这大灾祸攻击我们呢？我们有什么罪孽呢？我们向耶和华我们的　神犯了什么罪呢？’


耶16:11
> then say to them, 'It is because your fathers forsook me,' declares the LORD, 'and followed other gods and served and worshiped them. They forsook me and did not keep my law.
>
> 你就对他们说，耶和华说：‘因为你们列祖离弃我，随从别　神，事奉敬拜，不遵守我的律法。


耶16:12
> But you have behaved more wickedly than your fathers. See how each of you is following the stubbornness of his evil heart instead of obeying me.
>
> 而且你们行恶比你们列祖更甚；因为各人随从自己顽梗的恶心行事，甚至不听从我。


耶16:13
> So I will throw you out of this land into a land neither you nor your fathers have known, and there you will serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.'
>
> 所以我必将你们从这地赶出，直赶到你们和你们列祖素不认识的地，你们在那里必昼夜事奉别　神，因为我必不向你们施恩。’”


耶16:14
> "However, the days are coming," declares the LORD, "when men will no longer say, 'As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,'
>
> 耶和华说：“日子将到，人必不再指着那领以色列人从埃及地上来之永生的耶和华起誓，


耶16:15
> but they will say, 'As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them.' For I will restore them to the land I gave their forefathers.
>
> 却要指着那领以色列人从北方之地，并赶他们到的各国上来之永生的耶和华起誓，并且我要领他们再入我从前赐给他们列祖之地。”


耶16:16
> "But now I will send for many fishermen," declares the LORD, "and they will catch them. After that I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill and from the crevices of the rocks.
>
> 耶和华说：“我要召许多打鱼的，把以色列人打上来，然后我要召许多打猎的，从各山上、各冈上、各石穴中猎取他们。


耶16:17
> My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from me, nor is their sin concealed from my eyes.
>
> 因我的眼目察看他们的一切行为，他们不能在我面前遮掩；他们的罪孽，也不能在我眼前隐藏。


耶16:18
> I will repay them double for their wickedness and their sin, because they have defiled my land with the lifeless forms of their vile images and have filled my inheritance with their detestable idols."
>
> 我先要加倍报应他们的罪孽和罪恶，因为他们用可憎之尸玷污我的地土，又用可厌之物充满我的产业。”


耶16:19
> O LORD, my strength and my fortress, my refuge in time of distress, to you the nations will come from the ends of the earth and say, "Our fathers possessed nothing but false gods, worthless idols that did them no good.
>
> 耶和华啊，你是我的力量，是我的保障，在苦难之日是我的避难所。列国人必从地极来到你这里说：“我们列祖所承受的，不过是虚假，是虚空无益之物。


耶16:20
> Do men make their own gods? Yes, but they are not gods!"
>
> 人岂可为自己制造　神呢？其实这不是　神。”


耶16:21
> "Therefore I will teach them--this time I will teach them my power and might. Then they will know that my name is the LORD.
>
> 耶和华说：“我要使他们知道，就是这一次使他们知道我的手和我的能力；他们就知道我的名是耶和华了。

>
> 我田野的山哪，我必因你在四境之内所犯的罪，把你的货物、财宝，并邱坛当掠物交给仇敌。


耶17:4
> Through your own fault you will lose the inheritance I gave you. I will enslave you to your enemies in a land you do not know, for you have kindled my anger, and it will burn forever."
>
> 并且你因自己的罪，必失去我所赐给你的产业；我也必使你在你所不认识的地上，服事你的仇敌。因为你使我怒中起火，直烧到永远。”


耶17:5
> This is what the LORD says: "Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who depends on flesh for his strength and whose heart turns away from the LORD.

耶17:6
> He will be like a bush in the wastelands; he will not see prosperity when it comes. He will dwell in the parched places of the desert, in a salt land where no one lives.
>
> 因他必像沙漠的杜松，不见福乐来到，却要住旷野干旱之处，无人居住的硷地。


耶17:7
> "But blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him.
>
> 倚靠耶和华、以耶和华为可靠的，那人有福了！


耶17:8
> He will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit."
>
> 他必像树栽于水旁，在河边扎根，炎热来到，并不惧怕，叶子仍必青翠，在干旱之年毫无挂虑，而且结果不止。”


耶17:9

耶18:6
> "O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter does?" declares the LORD. "Like clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.

> 你们要对先知如此说：‘耶和华回答你什么？耶和华说了什么呢？’


耶23:38
> Although you claim, 'This is the oracle of the LORD,' this is what the LORD says: You used the words, 'This is the oracle of the LORD,' even though I told you that you must not claim, 'This is the oracle of the LORD.'

> Therefore, I will surely forget you and cast you out of my presence along with the city I gave to you and your fathers.

## 耶利米书第24章
耶24:1
> After Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and the officials, the craftsmen and the artisans of Judah were carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the LORD showed me two baskets of figs placed in front of the temple of the LORD.
>
> 巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒将犹大王约雅敬的儿子耶哥尼雅和犹大的首领，并工匠、铁匠从耶路撒冷掳去，带到巴比伦。这事以后，耶和华指给我看，有两筐无花果放在耶和华的殿前。


耶24:2
> One basket had very good figs, like those that ripen early; the other basket had very poor figs, so bad they could not be eaten.
>
> 一筐是极好的无花果，好像是初熟的；一筐是极坏的无花果，坏得不可吃。


耶24:3
> Then the LORD asked me, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" "Figs," I answered. "The good ones are very good, but the poor ones are so bad they cannot be eaten."
>
> 于是耶和华问我说：“耶利米你看见什么？”我说：“我看见无花果：好的极好，坏的极坏，坏得不可吃。”


耶24:4
> Then the word of the LORD came to me:
>
> 耶和华的话临到我说：


耶24:5
> "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Like these good figs, I regard as good the exiles from Judah, whom I sent away from this place to the land of the Babylonians.
>
> “耶和华以色列的　神如此说：‘被掳去的犹大人，就是我打发离开这地到迦勒底人之地去的，我必看顾他们如这好无花果，使他们得好处。


耶24:6
> My eyes will watch over them for their good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up and not tear them down; I will plant them and not uproot them.
>
> 我要眷顾他们，使他们得好处，领他们归回这地。我也要建立他们，必不拆毁；栽植他们，并不拔出。


耶24:7
> I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the LORD. They will be my people, and I will be their God, for they will return to me with all their heart.
>
> 我要赐他们认识我的心，知道我是耶和华。他们要作我的子民，我要作他们的　神，因为他们要一心归向我。’


耶24:8
> "'But like the poor figs, which are so bad they cannot be eaten,' says the LORD, 'so will I deal with Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials and the survivors from Jerusalem, whether they remain in this land or live in Egypt.
>
> 耶和华如此说：‘我必将犹大王西底家和他的首领，以及剩在这地耶路撒冷的余民，并住在埃及地的犹大人都交出来，好像那极坏、坏得不可吃的无花果。


耶24:9
> I will make them abhorrent and an offense to all the kingdoms of the earth, a reproach and a byword, an object of ridicule and cursing, wherever I banish them.
>
> 我必使他们交出来，在天下万国中抛来抛去，遭遇灾祸。在我赶逐他们到的各处，成为凌辱、笑谈、讥刺、咒诅。


耶24:10
> I will send the sword, famine and plague against them until they are destroyed from the land I gave to them and their fathers.'"
>
> 我必使刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫临到他们，直到他们从我所赐给他们和他们列祖之地灭绝。’”


## 耶利米书第25章
耶25:1
> The word came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
>
> 犹大王约西亚的儿子约雅敬第四年，就是巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒的元年，耶和华论犹大众民的话临到耶利米。


耶25:2
> So Jeremiah the prophet said to all the people of Judah and to all those living in Jerusalem:
>
> 先知耶利米就将这话对犹大众人和耶路撒冷的一切居民说：


耶25:3
> For twenty-three years--from the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah until this very day--the word of the LORD has come to me and I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened.
>
> 从犹大王亚们的儿子约西亚十三年直到今日，这二十三年之内，常有耶和华的话临到我，我也对你们传说，就是从早起来传说，只是你们没有听从。


耶25:4
> And though the LORD has sent all his servants the prophets to you again and again, you have not listened or paid any attention.
>
> 耶和华也从早起来，差遣他的仆人众先知到你们这里来（只是你们没有听从，也没有侧耳而听），


耶25:5
> They said, "Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways and your evil practices, and you can stay in the land the LORD gave to you and your fathers for ever and ever.
>
> 说：“你们各人当回头，离开恶道和所作的恶，便可居住耶和华古时所赐给你们和你们列祖之地，直到永远。


耶25:6
> Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them; do not provoke me to anger with what your hands have made. Then I will not harm you."
>
> 不可随从别　神事奉敬拜，以你们手所做的惹我发怒，这样，我就不加害与你们。


耶25:7
> "But you did not listen to me," declares the LORD, "and you have provoked me with what your hands have made, and you have brought harm to yourselves."
>
> 然而，你们没有听从我，竟以手所做的惹我发怒，陷害自己。”这是耶和华说的。


耶25:8
> Therefore the LORD Almighty says this: "Because you have not listened to my words,

> 所以万军之耶和华如此说：“因为你们没有听从我的话，


耶25:9

耶25:10
> I will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom, the sound of millstones and the light of the lamp.

耶25:12
> "But when the seventy years are fulfilled, I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation, the land of the Babylonians, for their guilt," declares the LORD, "and will make it desolate forever.
>
> 七十年满了以后，我必刑罚巴比伦王和那国民，并迦勒底人之地，因他们的罪孽使那地永远荒凉。”这是耶和华说的。


耶25:13
> I will bring upon that land all the things I have spoken against it, all that are written in this book and prophesied by Jeremiah against all the nations.
>
> “我也必使我向那地所说的话，就是记在这书上的话，是耶利米向这些国民说的预言，都临到那地。


耶25:14
> They themselves will be enslaved by many nations and great kings; I will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands."

> 或者他们肯听从，各人回头离开恶道，使我后悔不将我因他们所行的恶，想要施行的灾祸降与他们。


耶26:4
> Say to them, 'This is what the LORD says: If you do not listen to me and follow my law, which I have set before you,

耶26:19
> "Did Hezekiah king of Judah or anyone else in Judah put him to death? Did not Hezekiah fear the LORD and seek his favor? And did not the LORD relent, so that he did not bring the disaster he pronounced against them? We are about to bring a terrible disaster on ourselves!"

耶34:1
> While Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms and peoples in the empire he ruled were fighting against Jerusalem and all its surrounding towns, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
>
> 巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒率领他的全军和地上属他的各国各邦，攻打耶路撒冷和属耶路撒冷所有的城邑。那时，耶和华的话临到耶利米说：


耶34:2
> "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Go to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him, 'This is what the LORD says: I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down.

> “耶和华以色列的　神说：你去告诉犹大王西底家：‘耶和华如此说：我要将这城交付巴比伦王的手，他必用火焚烧。


耶34:3
> You will not escape from his grasp but will surely be captured and handed over to him. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes, and he will speak with you face to face. And you will go to Babylon.
>
> 你必不能逃脱他的手，定被拿住，交在他的手中。你的眼要见巴比伦王的眼，他要口对口和你说话，你也必到巴比伦去。


耶34:4
> "'Yet hear the promise of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah. This is what the LORD says concerning you: You will not die by the sword;
>
> 犹大王西底家啊，你还要听耶和华的话。耶和华论到你如此说：你必不被刀剑杀死，


耶34:5
> you will die peacefully. As people made a funeral fire in honor of your fathers, the former kings who preceded you, so they will make a fire in your honor and lament, "Alas, O master!" I myself make this promise, declares the LORD.'"
>
> 你必平安而死，人必为你焚烧物件，好像为你列祖，就是在你以前的先王焚烧一般。人必为你举哀说：哀哉！我主啊。耶和华说，这话是我说的。’”


耶34:6
> Then Jeremiah the prophet told all this to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem,
>
> 于是，先知耶利米在耶路撒冷将这一切话告诉犹大王西底家。


耶34:7
> while the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah that were still holding out--Lachish and Azekah. These were the only fortified cities left in Judah.
>
> 那时，巴比伦王的军队正攻打耶路撒冷，又攻打犹大所剩下的城邑，就是拉吉和亚西加。原来犹大的坚固城只剩下这两座。


耶34:8
> The word came to Jeremiah from the LORD after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for the slaves.
>
> 西底家王与耶路撒冷的众民立约，要向他们宣告自由，叫各人任他希伯来的仆人和婢女自由出去，谁也不可使他的一个犹大弟兄作奴仆。


耶34:9
> Everyone was to free his Hebrew slaves, both male and female; no one was to hold a fellow Jew in bondage.
>
> （此后，有耶和华的话临到耶利米。）


耶34:10
> So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage. They agreed, and set them free.
>
> 所有立约的首领和众民，就任他的仆人婢女自由出去，谁也不再叫他们作奴仆。大家都顺从，将他们释放了。


耶34:11
> But afterward they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again.
>
> 后来却又反悔，叫所任去自由的仆人婢女回来，勉强他们仍为仆婢。


耶34:12
> Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
>
> 因此，耶和华的话临到耶利米说：


耶34:13
> "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your forefathers when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. I said,

耶34:14
> 'Every seventh year each of you must free any fellow Hebrew who has sold himself to you. After he has served you six years, you must let him go free.' Your fathers, however, did not listen to me or pay attention to me.
>
> ‘你的一个希伯来弟兄若卖给你，服事你六年，到第七年你们各人就要任他自由出去。’只是你们列祖不听从我，也不侧耳而听。


耶34:15
> Recently you repented and did what is right in my sight: Each of you proclaimed freedom to his countrymen. You even made a covenant before me in the house that bears my Name.
>
> 如今你们回转，行我眼中看为正的事，各人向邻舍宣告自由，并且在称为我名下的殿中，在我面前立约。


耶34:16
> But now you have turned around and profaned my name; each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished. You have forced them to become your slaves again.
>
> 你们却又反悔，亵渎我的名，各人叫所任去随意自由的仆人婢女回来，勉强他们仍为仆婢。


耶34:17
> "Therefore, this is what the LORD says: You have not obeyed me; you have not proclaimed freedom for your fellow countrymen. So I now proclaim 'freedom' for you, declares the LORD--'freedom' to fall by the sword, plague and famine. I will make you abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth.
>
> 所以耶和华如此说：你们没有听从我，各人向弟兄邻舍宣告自由。看哪！我向你们宣告一样自由，就是使你们自由于刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫之下，并且使你们在天下万国中抛来抛去。这是耶和华说的。


耶34:18
> The men who have violated my covenant and have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant they made before me, I will treat like the calf they cut in two and then walked between its pieces.
>
> 犹大的首领，耶路撒冷的首领，太监，祭司，和国中的众民曾将牛犊劈开，分成两半，从其中经过，在我面前立约。


耶34:19
> The leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests and all the people of the land who walked between the pieces of the calf,
>
> 后来又违背我的约，不遵行这约上的话。


耶34:20
> I will hand over to their enemies who seek their lives. Their dead bodies will become food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.
>
> 我必将他们交在仇敌和寻索其命的人手中，他们的尸首必给空中的飞鸟和地上的野兽作食物。


耶34:21
> "I will hand Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials over to their enemies who seek their lives, to the army of the king of Babylon, which has withdrawn from you.
>
> 并且我必将犹大王西底家和他的首领交在他们仇敌和寻索其命的人，与那暂离你们而去巴比伦王军队的手中。


耶34:22
> I am going to give the order, declares the LORD, and I will bring them back to this city. They will fight against it, take it and burn it down. And I will lay waste the towns of Judah so no one can live there."
>
> 耶和华说：我必吩咐他们回到这城，攻打这城，将城攻取，用火焚烧。我也要使犹大的城邑变为荒场无人居住。”

耶35:5
> Then I set bowls full of wine and some cups before the men of the Recabite family and said to them, "Drink some wine."
>
> 于是，我在利甲族人面前设摆盛满酒的碗和杯，对他们说：“请你们喝酒。”


耶35:6
> But they replied, "We do not drink wine, because our forefather Jonadab son of Recab gave us this command: 'Neither you nor your descendants must ever drink wine.

>
> 耶利米来到狱中，进入牢房，在那里囚了多日。


耶37:17

>
> 西底家王打发人提出他来，在自己的宫内私下问他说：“从耶和华有什么话临到没有？”耶利米说：“有！”又说：“你必交在巴比伦王手中。”


耶37:18
> Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, "What crime have I committed against you or your officials or this people, that you have put me in prison?
>
> 耶利米又对西底家王说：“我在什么事上得罪你，或你的臣仆，或这百姓，你竟将我囚在监里呢？

耶38:1
> Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malkijah heard what Jeremiah was telling all the people when he said,
>
> 玛坦的儿子示法提雅、巴施户珥的儿子基大利、示利米雅的儿子犹甲、玛基雅的儿子巴示户珥听见耶利米对众人所说的话，说：


耶38:2
> "This is what the LORD says: 'Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine or plague, but whoever goes over to the Babylonians will live. He will escape with his life; he will live.'
>
> “耶和华如此说：‘住在这城里的必遭刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫而死；但出去归降迦勒底人的，必得存活，就是以自己命为掠物的，必得存活。’


耶38:3
> And this is what the LORD says: 'This city will certainly be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon, who will capture it.'"
>
> 耶和华如此说：‘这城必要交在巴比伦王军队的手中，他必攻取这城。’”


耶38:4
> Then the officials said to the king, "This man should be put to death. He is discouraging the soldiers who are left in this city, as well as all the people, by the things he is saying to them. This man is not seeking the good of these people but their ruin."
>
> 于是首领对王说：“求你将这人治死，因他向城里剩下的兵丁和众民说这样的话，使他们的手发软。这人不是求这百姓得平安，乃是叫他们受灾祸。”


耶38:5
> "He is in your hands," King Zedekiah answered. "The king can do nothing to oppose you."
>
> 西底家王说：“他在你们手中，无论何事，王也不能与你们反对。”


耶38:6
> So they took Jeremiah and put him into the cistern of Malkijah, the king's son, which was in the courtyard of the guard. They lowered Jeremiah by ropes into the cistern; it had no water in it, only mud, and Jeremiah sank down into the mud.
>
> 他们就拿住耶利米，下在哈米勒的儿子（或作“王的儿子”）玛基雅的牢狱里。那牢狱在护卫兵的院中。他们用绳子将耶利米系下去。牢狱里没有水，只有淤泥，耶利米就陷在淤泥中。


耶38:7
> But Ebed-Melech, a Cushite, an official in the royal palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. While the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate,

> 以伯米勒就从王宫里出来，对王说：


耶38:9
> "My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all they have done to Jeremiah the prophet. They have thrown him into a cistern, where he will starve to death when there is no longer any bread in the city."
>
> “主我的王啊，这些人向先知耶利米一味地行恶，将他下在牢狱中，他在那里必因饥饿而死，因为城中再没有粮食。”


耶38:10
> Then the king commanded Ebed-Melech the Cushite, "Take thirty men from here with you and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies."
>
> 王就吩咐古实人以伯米勒说：“你从这里带领三十人，趁着先知耶利米未死以前，将他从牢狱中提上来。”


耶38:11
> So Ebed-Melech took the men with him and went to a room under the treasury in the palace. He took some old rags and worn-out clothes from there and let them down with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.
>
> 于是，以伯米勒带领这些人同去，进入王宫，到库房以下，从那里取了些碎布和破烂的衣服，用绳子缒下牢狱去到耶利米那里。


耶38:12
> Ebed-Melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, "Put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your arms to pad the ropes." Jeremiah did so,
>
> 古实人以伯米勒对耶利米说：“你用这些碎布和破烂的衣服放在绳子上，垫你的胳肢窝。”耶利米就照样行了。


耶38:13
> and they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
>
> 这样，他们用绳子将耶利米从牢狱里拉上来。耶利米仍在护卫兵的院中。


耶38:14
> Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and had him brought to the third entrance to the temple of the LORD. "I am going to ask you something," the king said to Jeremiah. "Do not hide anything from me."
>
> 西底家王打发人带领先知耶利米，进耶和华殿中第三门里见王。王就对耶利米说：“我要问你一件事，你丝毫不可向我隐瞒。”


耶38:15
> Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "If I give you an answer, will you not kill me? Even if I did give you counsel, you would not listen to me."
>
> 耶利米对西底家说：“我若告诉你，你岂不定要杀我吗？我若劝戒你，你必不听从我。”


耶38:16
> But King Zedekiah swore this oath secretly to Jeremiah: "As surely as the LORD lives, who has given us breath, I will neither kill you nor hand you over to those who are seeking your life."
>
> 西底家王就私下向耶利米说：“我指着那造我们生命之永生的耶和华起誓，我必不杀你，也不将你交在寻索你命的人手中。”


耶38:17
> Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "This is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down; you and your family will live.
>
> 耶利米对西底家说：“耶和华万军之神、以色列的　神如此说：‘你若出去归降巴比伦王的首领，你的命就必存活，这城也不至被火焚烧，你和你的全家都必存活；


耶38:18
> But if you will not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, this city will be handed over to the Babylonians and they will burn it down; you yourself will not escape from their hands.'"
>
> 你若不出去归降巴比伦王的首领，这城必交在迦勒底人手中，他们必用火焚烧，你也不得脱离他们的手。’”


耶38:19
> King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "I am afraid of the Jews who have gone over to the Babylonians, for the Babylonians may hand me over to them and they will mistreat me."
>
> 西底家王对耶利米说：“我怕那些投降迦勒底人的犹大人，恐怕迦勒底人将我交在他们手中，他们戏弄我。”


耶38:20
> "They will not hand you over," Jeremiah replied. "Obey the LORD by doing what I tell you. Then it will go well with you, and your life will be spared.
>
> 耶利米说：“迦勒底人必不将你交出。求你听从我对你所说耶和华的话，这样，你必得好处，你的命也必存活，


耶38:21
> But if you refuse to surrender, this is what the LORD has revealed to me:
>
> 你若不肯出去，耶和华指示我的话乃是这样：


耶38:22
> All the women left in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon. Those women will say to you: "'They misled you and overcame you--those trusted friends of yours. Your feet are sunk in the mud; your friends have deserted you.'
>
> ‘犹大王宫里所剩的妇女必都带到巴比伦王的首领那里。这些妇女必说：你知己的朋友催逼你，胜过你；见你的脚陷入淤泥中，就转身退后了。’


耶38:23
> "All your wives and children will be brought out to the Babylonians. You yourself will not escape from their hands but will be captured by the king of Babylon; and this city will be burned down."
>
> 人必将你的后妃和你的儿女带到迦勒底人那里。你也不得脱离他们的手，必被巴比伦王的手捉住，你也必使这城被火焚烧。”


耶38:24
> Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "Do not let anyone know about this conversation, or you may die.
>
> 西底家对耶利米说：“不要使人知道这些话，你就不至于死，


耶38:25
> If the officials hear that I talked with you, and they come to you and say, 'Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us or we will kill you,'

耶38:27
> All the officials did come to Jeremiah and question him, and he told them everything the king had ordered him to say. So they said no more to him, for no one had heard his conversation with the king.

> 随后众首领来见耶利米，问他，他就照王所吩咐的一切话回答他们。他们不再与他说话，因为事情没有泄漏。


耶38:28
> And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard until the day Jerusalem was captured.
