This week I was successful in creating a prototype animation state machine for Katt. It was a simple enough affair
as I had some experience making one in the last Global Game Jam. Here's a quick look at the state machine in its 
current form.

Katt's animation state machine at the moment. Of course it'll need various tweaks and additions down the line.

I've tested the state machine in-game and it seems to change animations according to when I want them to change.
There will be certain things I will need to adjust or fix later on, though I will likely leave it until the final
animations are in as it will be much easier to test them. At the moment it can be hard to differentiate the animations
by a change in colour alone.

I've added this new animated Katt to each of our test scenes. In the Movement Test Scene I've added the new Katt 
alongside the old Katt, so that the others can continue working with the other Katt object if they so wish. To this
end, I've added a function to the camera follow script that allows it to find the object in the scene containing 
the name "katt" and set it as the object to follow. Now, whoever wants to test a particular Katt can simply deactivate 
the other Katt and the camera will automatically follow the one remaining.

That's all for this week, apart from working on the animation state machine I've continued to search for answers on
the Tilemap issue, but to no avail. However, I have heard from a friend that using raycasts with normals may be an
alternative to my angle tile idea. This'll require further investigation.

'Til next time!
