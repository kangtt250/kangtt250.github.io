>
> 说：“耶和华曾吩咐我主，拈阄分地给以色列人为业，我主也受了耶和华的吩咐，将我们兄弟西罗非哈的产业分给他的众女儿。


民36:3
> Now suppose they marry men from other Israelite tribes; then their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral inheritance and added to that of the tribe they marry into. And so part of the inheritance allotted to us will be taken away.
>
> 她们若嫁以色列别支派的人，就必将我们祖宗所遗留的产业加在她们丈夫支派的产业中。这样，我们拈阄所得的产业就要减少了。

> This is what the LORD commands for Zelophehad's daughters: They may marry anyone they please as long as they marry within the tribal clan of their father.
>
> 论到西罗非哈的众女儿，耶和华这样吩咐说：‘她们可以随意嫁人，只是要嫁同宗支派的人。’


民36:7
> No inheritance in Israel is to pass from tribe to tribe, for every Israelite shall keep the tribal land inherited from his forefathers.
>
> 这样，以色列人的产业就不从这支派归到那支派，因为以色列人要各守各祖宗支派的产业。
