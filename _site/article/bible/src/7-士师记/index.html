I have given the land into their hands.”<p>耶和华说：“犹大当先上去，我已将那地交在他手中。”</blockquote><p>士1:3<blockquote><p>Then the men of Judah said to the Simeonites their brothers, “Come up with us into the territory allotted to us, to fight against the Canaanites. We in turn will go with you into yours.” So the Simeonites went with them.<p>犹大对他哥哥西缅说：“请你同我到拈阄所得之地去，好与迦南人争战；以后我也同你到你拈阄所得之地去。”于是西缅与他同去。</blockquote><p>士1:4<blockquote><p>When Judah attacked, the LORD gave the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek.<p>犹大就上去。耶和华将迦南人和比利洗人交在他们手中，他们在比色击杀了一万人。</blockquote><p>士1:5<blockquote><p>It was there that they found Adoni-Bezek and fought against him, putting to rout the Canaanites and Perizzites.<p>又在那里遇见亚多尼比色，与他争战，杀败迦南人和比利洗人。</blockquote><p>士1:6<blockquote><p>Adoni-Bezek fled, but they chased him and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes.<p>亚多尼比色逃跑，他们追赶，拿住他，砍断他手脚的大拇指。</blockquote><p>士1:7<blockquote><p>Then Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have picked up scraps under my table. Now God has paid me back for what I did to them.” They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.<p>亚多尼比色说：“从前有七十个王，手脚的大拇指都被我砍断，在我桌子底下拾取零碎食物。现在　神按着我所行的报应我了。”于是，他们将亚多尼比色带到耶路撒冷，他就死在那里。</blockquote><p>士1:8<blockquote><p>The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem also and took it. They put the city to the sword and set it on fire.<p>犹大人攻打耶路撒冷，将城攻取，用刀杀了城内的人，并且放火烧城。</blockquote><p>士1:9<blockquote><p>After that, the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev and the western foothills.<p>后来犹大人下去，与住山地、南地和高原的迦南人争战。</blockquote><p>士1:10<blockquote><p>They advanced against the Canaanites living in Hebron (formerly called Kiriath Arba) and defeated Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai.<p>犹大人去攻击住希伯仑的迦南人，杀了示筛、亚希幔、挞买。希伯仑从前名叫基列亚巴。</blockquote><p>士1:11<blockquote><p>From there they advanced against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher).<p>他们从那里去攻击底璧的居民。底璧从前名叫基列西弗。</blockquote><p>士1:12<blockquote><p>And Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher.”<p>迦勒说：“谁能攻打基列西弗，将城夺取，我就把我女儿押撒给他为妻。”</blockquote><p>士1:13<blockquote><p>Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it; so Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him in marriage.<p>迦勒兄弟基纳斯的儿子俄陀聂夺取了那城，迦勒就把女儿押撒给他为妻。</blockquote><p>士1:14<blockquote><p>One day when she came to Othniel, she urged him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What can I do for you?”<p>押撒过门的时候，劝丈夫向她父亲求一块田。押撒一下驴，迦勒问她说：“你要什么？”</blockquote><p>士1:15<blockquote><p>She replied, “Do me a special favor. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water.” Then Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.<p>她说：“求你赐福给我。你既将我安置在南地，求你也给我水泉。”迦勒就把上泉下泉赐给她。</blockquote><p>士1:16<blockquote><p>The descendants of Moses’ father-in-law, the Kenite, went up from the City of Palms with the men of Judah to live among the people of the Desert of Judah in the Negev near Arad.<p>摩西的内兄（或作“岳父”）是基尼人，他的子孙与犹大人一同离了棕树城，往亚拉得以南的犹大旷野去，就住在民中。</blockquote><p>士1:17<blockquote><p>Then the men of Judah went with the Simeonites their brothers and attacked the Canaanites living in Zephath, and they totally destroyed the city. Therefore it was called Hormah.<p>犹大和他哥哥西缅同去，击杀了住洗法的迦南人，将城尽行毁灭，那城的名便叫何珥玛。</blockquote><p>士1:18<blockquote><p>The men of Judah also took Gaza, Ashkelon and Ekron–each city with its territory.<p>犹大又取了迦萨和迦萨的四境，亚实基伦和亚实基伦的四境，以革伦和以革伦的四境。</blockquote><p>士1:19<blockquote><p>The LORD was with the men of Judah. They took possession of the hill country, but they were unable to drive the people from the plains, because they had iron chariots.<p>耶和华与犹大同在，犹大就赶出山地的居民，只是不能赶出平原的居民，因为他们有铁车。</blockquote><p>士1:20<blockquote><p>As Moses had promised, Hebron was given to Caleb, who drove from it the three sons of Anak.<p>以色列人照摩西所说的，将希伯仑给了迦勒，迦勒就从那里赶出亚衲族的三个族长。</blockquote><p>士1:21<blockquote><p>The Benjamites, however, failed to dislodge the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem; to this day the Jebusites live there with the Benjamites.<p>便雅悯人没有赶出住耶路撒冷的耶布斯人，耶布斯人仍在耶路撒冷与便雅悯人同住，直到今日。</blockquote><p>士1:22<blockquote><p>Now the house of Joseph attacked Bethel, and the LORD was with them.<p>约瑟家也上去攻打伯特利，耶和华与他们同在。</blockquote><p>士1:23<blockquote><p>When they sent men to spy out Bethel (formerly called Luz),<p>约瑟家打发人去窥探伯特利。那城起先名叫路斯。</blockquote><p>士1:24<blockquote><p>the spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him, “Show us how to get into the city and we will see that you are treated well.”<p>窥探的人看见一个人从城里出来，就对他说：“求你将进城的路指示我们，我们必恩待你。”</blockquote><p>士1:25<blockquote><p>So he showed them, and they put the city to the sword but spared the man and his whole family.<p>那人将进城的路指示他们，他们就用刀击杀了城中的居民，但将那人和他全家放去。</blockquote><p>士1:26<blockquote><p>He then went to the land of the Hittites, where he built a city and called it Luz, which is its name to this day.<p>那人往赫人之地去，筑了一座城，起名叫路斯。那城到如今还叫这名。</blockquote><p>士1:27<blockquote><p>But Manasseh did not drive out the people of Beth Shan or Taanach or Dor or Ibleam or Megiddo and their surrounding settlements, for the Canaanites were determined to live in that land.<p>玛拿西没有赶出伯善和属伯善乡村的居民，他纳和属他纳乡村的居民，多珥和属多珥乡村的居民，以伯莲和属以伯莲乡村的居民，米吉多和属米吉多乡村的居民。迦南人却执意住在那些地方。</blockquote><p>士1:28<blockquote><p>When Israel became strong, they pressed the Canaanites into forced labor but never drove them out completely.<p>及至以色列强盛了，就使迦南人做苦工，没有把他们全然赶出。</blockquote><p>士1:29<blockquote><p>Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, but the Canaanites continued to live there among them.<p>以法莲没有赶出住基色的迦南人。于是，迦南人仍住在基色，在以法莲中间。</blockquote><p>士1:30<blockquote><p>Neither did Zebulun drive out the Canaanites living in Kitron or Nahalol, who remained among them; but they did subject them to forced labor.<p>西布伦没有赶出基伦的居民和拿哈拉的居民。于是迦南人仍住在西布伦中间，成了服苦的人。</blockquote><p>士1:31<blockquote><p>Nor did Asher drive out those living in Acco or Sidon or Ahlab or Aczib or Helbah or Aphek or Rehob,<p>亚设没有赶出亚柯和西顿的居民，亚黑拉和亚革悉的居民，黑巴、亚弗革与利合的居民。</blockquote><p>士1:32<blockquote><p>and because of this the people of Asher lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land.<p>于是，亚设因为没有赶出那地的迦南人，就住在他们中间。</blockquote><p>士1:33<blockquote><p>Neither did Naphtali drive out those living in Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath; but the Naphtalites too lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, and those living in Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath became forced laborers for them.<p>拿弗他利没有赶出伯示麦和伯亚纳的居民。于是，拿弗他利就住在那地的迦南人中间，然而伯示麦和伯亚纳的居民，成了服苦的人。</blockquote><p>士1:34<blockquote><p>The Amorites confined the Danites to the hill country, not allowing them to come down into the plain.<p>亚摩利人强逼但人住在山地，不容他们下到平原。</blockquote><p>士1:35<blockquote><p>And the Amorites were determined also to hold out in Mount Heres, Aijalon and Shaalbim, but when the power of the house of Joseph increased, they too were pressed into forced labor.<p>亚摩利人却执意住在希烈山和亚雅伦并沙宾。然而约瑟家胜了他们，使他们成了服苦的人。</blockquote><p>士1:36<blockquote><p>The boundary of the Amorites was from Scorpion Pass to Sela and beyond.<p>亚摩利人的境界，是从亚克拉滨坡，从西拉而上。</blockquote><h2 id="士师记第2章">士师记第2章</h2><p>士2:1<blockquote><p>The angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said, “I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land that I swore to give to your forefathers. I said, ‘I will never break my covenant with you,<p>耶和华的使者从吉甲上到波金，对以色列人说：“我使你们从埃及上来，领你们到我向你们列祖起誓应许之地。我又说：‘我永不废弃与你们所立的约。</blockquote><p>士2:2<blockquote><p>and you shall not make a covenant with the people of this land, but you shall break down their altars.’ Yet you have disobeyed me. Why have you done this?<p>你们也不可与这地的居民立约，要拆毁他们的祭坛。’你们竟没有听从我的话！为何这样行呢？</blockquote><p>士2:3<blockquote><p>Now therefore I tell you that I will not drive them out before you; they will be thorns in your sides and their gods will be a snare to you.”<p>因此我又说：‘我必不将他们从你们面前赶出。他们必作你们肋下的荆棘，他们的　神必作你们的网罗。’”</blockquote><p>士2:4<blockquote><p>When the angel of the LORD had spoken these things to all the Israelites, the people wept aloud,<p>耶和华的使者向以色列众人说这话的时候，百姓就放声而哭。</blockquote><p>士2:5<blockquote><p>and they called that place Bokim. There they offered sacrifices to the LORD.<p>于是给那地方起名叫波金（就是“哭”的意思），众人在那里向耶和华献祭。</blockquote><p>士2:6<blockquote><p>After Joshua had dismissed the Israelites, they went to take possession of the land, each to his own inheritance.<p>从前约书亚打发以色列百姓去的时候，他们各归自己的地业，占据地土。</blockquote><p>士2:7<blockquote><p>The people served the LORD throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had seen all the great things the LORD had done for Israel.<p>约书亚在世和约书亚死后，那些见耶和华为以色列人所行大事的长老还在的时候，百姓都事奉耶和华。</blockquote><p>士2:8<blockquote><p>Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of a hundred and ten.<p>耶和华的仆人，嫩的儿子约书亚，正一百一十岁就死了。</blockquote><p>士2:9<blockquote><p>And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Heres in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.<p>以色列人将他葬在他地业的境内，就是在以法莲山地的亭拿希烈，在迦实山的北边。</blockquote><p>士2:10<blockquote><p>After that whole generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation grew up, who knew neither the LORD nor what he had done for Israel.<p>那世代的人也都归了自己的列祖。后来有别的世代兴起，不知道耶和华，也不知道耶和华为以色列人所行的事。</blockquote><p>士2:11<blockquote><p>Then the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD and served the Baals.<p>以色列人行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，去事奉诸巴力，</blockquote><p>士2:12<blockquote><p>They forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of Egypt. They followed and worshiped various gods of the peoples around them. They provoked the LORD to anger<p>离弃了领他们出埃及地的耶和华、他们列祖的　神，去叩拜别　神，就是四围列国的神，惹耶和华发怒。</blockquote><p>士2:13<blockquote><p>because they forsook him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.<p>并离弃耶和华，去事奉巴力和亚斯她录。</blockquote><p>士2:14<blockquote><p>In his anger against Israel the LORD handed them over to raiders who plundered them. He sold them to their enemies all around, whom they were no longer able to resist.<p>耶和华的怒气向以色列人发作，就把他们交在抢夺他们的人手中。又将他们付与四围仇敌的手中，甚至他们在仇敌面前再不能站立得住。</blockquote><p>士2:15<blockquote><p>Whenever Israel went out to fight, the hand of the LORD was against them to defeat them, just as he had sworn to them.

What have you done to us?” He answered, “I merely did to them what they did to me.”<p>于是，有三千犹大人下到以坦磐的穴内，对参孙说：“非利士人辖制我们，你不知道吗？你向我们行的是什么事呢？”他回答说：“他们向我怎样行，我也要向他们怎样行！”</blockquote><p>士15:12<blockquote><p>They said to him, “We’ve come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines.” Samson said, “Swear to me that you won’t kill me yourselves.”<p>犹大人对他说：“我们下来是要捆绑你，将你交在非利士人手中。”参孙说：“你们要向我起誓，应承你们自己不害死我。”</blockquote><p>士15:13<blockquote><p>“Agreed,” they answered. “We will only tie you up and hand you over to them. We will not kill you.” So they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock.<p>他们说：“我们断不杀你，只要将你捆绑，交在非利士人手中。”于是用两条新绳捆绑参孙，将他从以坦磐带上去。</blockquote><p>士15:14<blockquote><p>As he approached Lehi, the Philistines came toward him shouting. The Spirit of the LORD came upon him in power. The ropes on his arms became like charred flax, and the bindings dropped from his hands.<p>参孙到了利希，非利士人都迎着喧嚷。耶和华的灵大大感动参孙，他臂上的绳就像火烧的麻一样，他的绑绳都从他手上脱落下来。</blockquote><p>士15:15<blockquote><p>Finding a fresh jawbone of a donkey, he grabbed it and struck down a thousand men.<p>他见一块未干的驴腮骨，就伸手拾起来，用以击杀一千人。</blockquote><p>士15:16<blockquote><p>Then Samson said, “With a donkey’s jawbone I have made donkeys of them. With a donkey’s jawbone I have killed a thousand men.”<p>参孙说：“我用驴腮骨杀人成堆，用驴腮骨杀了一千人。”</blockquote><p>士15:17<blockquote><p>When he finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone; and the place was called Ramath Lehi.<p>说完这话，就把那腮骨从手里抛出去了。那地便叫拉末利希。</blockquote><p>士15:18<blockquote><p>Because he was very thirsty, he cried out to the LORD, “You have given your servant this great victory. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?”<p>参孙甚觉口渴，就求告耶和华说：“你既借仆人的手施行这么大的拯救，岂可任我渴死，落在未受割礼的人手中呢？”</blockquote><p>士15:19<blockquote><p>Then God opened up the hollow place in Lehi, and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his strength returned and he revived.

He had with him his servant and two donkeys. She took him into her father’s house, and when her father saw him, he gladly welcomed him.<p>她丈夫起来，带着一个仆人、两匹驴去见她，用好话劝她回来。女子就引丈夫进入父家。她父见了那人，便欢欢喜喜地迎接。</blockquote><p>士19:4<blockquote><p>His father-in-law, the girl’s father, prevailed upon him to stay; so he remained with him three days, eating and drinking, and sleeping there.<p>那人的岳父，就是女子的父亲，将那人留下住了三天。于是二人一同吃喝住宿。</blockquote><p>士19:5<blockquote><p>On the fourth day they got up early and he prepared to leave, but the girl’s father said to his son-in-law, “Refresh yourself with something to eat; then you can go.”<p>到第四天，利未人清早起来要走，女子的父亲对女婿说：“请你吃点饭，加添心力，然后可以行路。”</blockquote><p>士19:6<blockquote><p>So the two of them sat down to eat and drink together. Afterward the girl’s father said, “Please stay tonight and enjoy yourself.”<p>于是二人坐下一同吃喝。女子的父亲对那人说：“请你再住一夜，畅快你的心。”</blockquote><p>士19:7<blockquote><p>And when the man got up to go, his father-in-law persuaded him, so he stayed there that night.<p>那人起来要走，他岳父强留他，他又住了一宿。</blockquote><p>士19:8<blockquote><p>On the morning of the fifth day, when he rose to go, the girl’s father said, “Refresh yourself. Wait till afternoon!” So the two of them ate together.<p>到第五天，他清早起来要走。女子的父亲说：“请你吃点饭，加添心力，等到日头偏西再走。”于是二人一同吃饭。</blockquote><p>士19:9<blockquote><p>Then when the man, with his concubine and his servant, got up to leave, his father-in-law, the girl’s father, said, “Now look, it’s almost evening. Spend the night here; the day is nearly over. Stay and enjoy yourself. Early tomorrow morning you can get up and be on your way home.”<p>那人同他的妾和仆人起来要走，他岳父，就是女子的父亲，对他说：“看哪，日头偏西了，请你再住一夜，天快晚了，可以在这里住宿，畅快你的心。明天早早起行回家去。”</blockquote><p>士19:10<blockquote><p>But, unwilling to stay another night, the man left and went toward Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine.<p>那人不愿再住一夜，就备上那两匹驴，带着妾起身走了，来到耶布斯的对面。耶布斯就是耶路撒冷。</blockquote><p>士19:11<blockquote><p>When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant said to his master, “Come, let’s stop at this city of the Jebusites and spend the night.”<p>临近耶布斯的时候，日头快要落了。仆人对主人说：“我们不如进这耶布斯人的城里住宿。”</blockquote><p>士19:12<blockquote><p>His master replied, “No. We won’t go into an alien city, whose people are not Israelites. We will go on to Gibeah.”<p>主人回答说：“我们不可进不是以色列人住的外邦城，不如过到基比亚去。”</blockquote><p>士19:13<blockquote><p>He added, “Come, let’s try to reach Gibeah or Ramah and spend the night in one of those places.”<p>又对仆人说：“我们可以到一个地方，或住在基比亚，或住在拉玛。”</blockquote><p>士19:14<blockquote><p>So they went on, and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin.<p>他们就往前走。将到便雅悯的基比亚，日头已经落了。</blockquote><p>士19:15<blockquote><p>There they stopped to spend the night. They went and sat in the city square, but no one took them into his home for the night.<p>他们进入基比亚，要在那里住宿，就坐在城里的街上，因为无人接他们进家住宿。</blockquote><p>士19:16<blockquote><p>That evening an old man from the hill country of Ephraim, who was living in Gibeah (the men of the place were Benjamites), came in from his work in the fields.<p>晚上，有一个老年人，从田间做工回来，他原是以法莲山地的人，住在基比亚，那地方的人却是便雅悯人。</blockquote><p>士19:17<blockquote><p>When he looked and saw the traveler in the city square, the old man asked, “Where are you going? Where did you come from?”<p>老年人举目看见客人坐在城里的街上，就问他说：“你从哪里来？要往哪里去？”</blockquote><p>士19:18<blockquote><p>He answered, “We are on our way from Bethlehem in Judah to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim where I live. I have been to Bethlehem in Judah and now I am going to the house of the LORD. No one has taken me into his house.<p>他回答说：“我们从犹大伯利恒来，要往以法莲山地那边去。我原是那里的人，到过犹大伯利恒，现在我往耶和华的殿去，在这里无人接我进他的家。</blockquote><p>士19:19<blockquote><p>We have both straw and fodder for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves your servants–me, your maidservant, and the young man with us. We don’t need anything.”<p>其实，我有粮草可以喂驴，我与我的妾并我的仆人，有饼有酒，并不缺少什么。”</blockquote><p>士19:20<blockquote><p>“You are welcome at my house,” the old man said. “Let me supply whatever you need. Only don’t spend the night in the square.”<p>老年人说：“愿你平安！你所需用的我都给你，只是不可在街上过夜。”</blockquote><p>士19:21<blockquote><p>So he took him into his house and fed his donkeys. After they had washed their feet, they had something to eat and drink.<p>于是领他们到家里，喂上驴，他们就洗脚吃喝。</blockquote><p>士19:22<blockquote><p>While they were enjoying themselves, some of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they shouted to the old man who owned the house, “Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him.”<p>他们心里正欢畅的时候，城中的匪徒围住房子，连连叩门，对房主老人说：“你把那进你家的人带出来，我们要与他交合。”</blockquote><p>士19:23<blockquote><p>The owner of the house went outside and said to them, “No, my friends, don’t be so vile. Since this man is my guest, don’t do this disgraceful thing.<p>那房主出来对他们说：“弟兄们哪，不要这样作恶。这人既然进了我的家，你们就不要行这丑事。</blockquote><p>士19:24<blockquote><p>Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But to this man, don’t do such a disgraceful thing.”<p>我有个女儿，还是处女，并有这人的妾，我将她们领出来任凭你们玷辱她们，只是向这人不可行这样的丑事。”</blockquote><p>士19:25<blockquote><p>But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go.<p>那些人却不听从他的话。那人就把他的妾拉出去交给他们，他们便与她交合，终夜凌辱她，直到天色快亮才放她去。</blockquote><p>士19:26<blockquote><p>At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell down at the door and lay there until daylight.<p>天快亮的时候，妇人回到她主人住宿的房门前，就仆倒在地，直到天亮。</blockquote><p>士19:27<blockquote><p>When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way, there lay his concubine, fallen in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold.<p>早晨，她的主人起来开了房门，出去要行路，不料那妇人仆倒在房门前，两手搭在门槛上，</blockquote><p>士19:28<blockquote><p>He said to her, “Get up; let’s go.” But there was no answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home.<p>就对妇人说：“起来，我们走吧！”妇人却不回答。那人便将她驮在驴上，起身回本处去了。</blockquote><p>士19:29<blockquote><p>When he reached home, he took a knife and cut up his concubine, limb by limb, into twelve parts and sent them into all the areas of Israel.<p>到了家里，用刀将妾的尸身切成十二块，使人拿着传送以色列的四境。</blockquote><p>士19:30<blockquote><p>Everyone who saw it said, “Such a thing has never been seen or done, not since the day the Israelites came up out of Egypt. Think about it! Consider it! Tell us what to do!”<p>凡看见的人都说：“从以色列人出埃及地，直到今日，这样的事没有行过，也没有见过。现在应当思想，大家商议当怎样办理。”</blockquote><h2 id="士师记第20章">士师记第20章</h2><p>士20:1<blockquote><p>Then all the Israelites from Dan to Beersheba and from the land of Gilead came out as one man and assembled before the LORD in Mizpah.<p>于是，以色列从但到别是巴，以及住基列地的众人都出来如同一人，聚集在米斯巴耶和华面前。</blockquote><p>士20:2<blockquote><p>The leaders of all the people of the tribes of Israel took their places in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand soldiers armed with swords.<p>以色列民的首领，就是各支派的军长，都站在　神百姓的会中；拿刀的步兵共有四十万。</blockquote><p>士20:3<blockquote><p>(The Benjamites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah.)
