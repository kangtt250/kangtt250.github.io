# 出埃及记
## 出埃及记第1章
出1:1
> These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:
>
> 以色列的众子，各带家眷和雅各一同来到埃及。他们的名字记在下面：


出1:2
> Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;
>
> 有流便、西缅、利未、犹大、


出1:3
> Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;
>
> 以萨迦、西布伦、便雅悯、


出1:4
> Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.
>
> 但、拿弗他利、迦得、亚设。


出1:5
> The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy in all; Joseph was already in Egypt.
>
> 凡从雅各而生的，共有七十人；约瑟已经在埃及。


出1:6
> Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,
>
> 约瑟和他的弟兄，并那一代的人都死了。


出1:7
> but the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them.
>
> 以色列人生养众多，并且繁茂，极其强盛，满了那地。


出1:8
> Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.
>
> 有不认识约瑟的新王起来，治理埃及。


出1:9
> "Look," he said to his people, "the Israelites have become much too numerous for us.
>
> 对他的百姓说：“看哪，这以色列民比我们还多，又比我们强盛。


出1:10
> Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country."
>
> 来吧！我们不如用巧计待他们，恐怕他们多起来，日后若遇什么争战的事，就连合我们的仇敌攻击我们，离开这地去了。”


出1:11
> So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.
>
> 于是埃及人派督工的辖制他们，加重担苦害他们。他们为法老建造两座积货城，就是比东和兰塞。


出1:12
> But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites
>
> 只是越发苦害他们，他们越发多起来，越发蔓延，埃及人就因以色列人愁烦。


出1:13
> and worked them ruthlessly.
>
> 埃及人严严地使以色列人作工，


出1:14
> They made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.
>
> 使他们因作苦工觉得命苦；无论是和泥，是做砖，是作田间各样的工，在一切的工上都严严地待他们。


出1:15
> The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,
>
> 有希伯来的两个收生婆，一名施弗拉，一名普阿。埃及王对她们说：


出1:16
> "When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live."
>
> “你们为希伯来妇人收生，看她们临盆的时候，若是男孩，就把他杀了；若是女孩，就留她存活。”


出1:17
> The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live.
>
> 但是收生婆敬畏　神，不照埃及王的吩咐行，竟存留男孩的性命。


出1:18
> Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?"
>
> 埃及王召了收生婆来说：“你们为什么作这事，存留男孩的性命呢？”


出1:19
> The midwives answered Pharaoh, "Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive."
>
> 收生婆对法老说：“因为希伯来妇人与埃及妇人不同，希伯来妇人本是健壮的（原文作“活泼的”），收生婆还没有到，她们已经生产了。”


出1:20
> So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous.
>
> 神厚待收生婆。以色列人多起来，极其强盛。


出1:21
> And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.
>
> 收生婆因为敬畏　神，　神便叫她们成立家室。


出1:22
> Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: "Every boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live."
>
> 法老吩咐他的众民说：“以色列人所生的男孩，你们都要丢在河里；一切的女孩，你们要存留她的性命。”


## 出埃及记第2章
出2:1
> Now a man of the house of Levi married a Levite woman,
>
> 有一个利未家的人，娶了一个利未女子为妻。


出2:2
> and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months.
>
> 那女人怀孕，生一个儿子，见他俊美，就藏了他三个月。


出2:3
> But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.
>
> 后来不能再藏，就取了一个蒲草箱，抹上石漆和石油，将孩子放在里头，把箱子搁在河边的芦荻中。


出2:4
> His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.
>
> 孩子的姐姐远远站着，要知道他究竟怎么样。


出2:5
> Then Pharaoh's daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the river bank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her slave girl to get it.
>
> 法老的女儿来到河边洗澡，她的使女们在河边行走。她看见箱子在芦荻中，就打发一个婢女拿来。


出2:6
> She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. "This is one of the Hebrew babies," she said.
>
> 她打开箱子，看见那孩子。孩子哭了，她就可怜他说：“这是希伯来人的一个孩子。”


出2:7
> Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?"
>
> 孩子的姐姐对法老的女儿说：“我去在希伯来妇人中，叫一个奶妈来，为你奶这孩子，可以不可以？”


出2:8
> "Yes, go," she answered. And the girl went and got the baby's mother.
>
> 法老的女儿说：“可以。”童女就去叫了孩子的母亲来。


出2:9
> Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you." So the woman took the baby and nursed him.
>
> 法老的女儿对她说：“你把这孩子抱去，为我奶他，我必给你工价。”妇人就抱了孩子去奶他。


出2:10
> When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses, saying, "I drew him out of the water."
>
> 孩子渐长，妇人把他带到法老的女儿那里，就作了她的儿子。她给孩子起名叫摩西，意思说：“因我把他从水里拉出来。”


出2:11
> One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.
>
> 后来摩西长大，他出去到他弟兄那里，看他们的重担，见一个埃及人打希伯来人的一个弟兄。


出2:12
> Glancing this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
>
> 他左右观看，见没有人，就把埃及人打死了，藏在沙土里。


出2:13
> The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, "Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?"
>
> 第二天他出去，见有两个希伯来人争斗，就对那欺负人的说：“你为什么打你同族的人呢？”


出2:14
> The man said, "Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid and thought, "What I did must have become known."
>
> 那人说：“谁立你作我们的首领和审判官呢？难道你要杀我，像杀那埃及人吗？”摩西便惧怕，说：“这事必是被人知道了。”


出2:15
> When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well.
>
> 法老听见这事，就想杀摩西，但摩西躲避法老，逃往米甸地居住。


出2:16
> Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father's flock.
>
> 一日，他在井旁坐下，米甸的祭司有七个女儿，她们来打水，打满了槽，要饮父亲的群羊。


出2:17
> Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock.
>
> 有牧羊的人来把她们赶走了，摩西却起来帮助她们，又饮了她们的群羊。


出2:18
> When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, "Why have you returned so early today?"
>
> 她们来到父亲流珥那里，他说：“今日你们为何来得这么快呢？”


出2:19
> They answered, "An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock."
>
> 她们说：“有一个埃及人救我们脱离牧羊人的手，并且为我们打水饮了群羊。”


出2:20
> "And where is he?" he asked his daughters. "Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat."
>
> 他对女儿们说：“那个人在哪里？你们为什么撇下他呢？你们去请他来吃饭。”


出2:21
> Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.
>
> 摩西甘心和那人同住；那人把他的女儿西坡拉给摩西为妻。


出2:22
> Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, saying, "I have become an alien in a foreign land."
>
> 西坡拉生了一个儿子，摩西给他起名叫革舜，意思说：“因我在外邦作了寄居的。”


出2:23
> During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God.
>
> 过了多年，埃及王死了。以色列人因作苦工，就叹息哀求，他们的哀声达于　神。


出2:24
> God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob.
>
> 神听见他们的哀声，就记念他与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各所立的约。


出2:25
> So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them.
>
> 神看顾以色列人，也知道他们的苦情。


## 出埃及记第3章
出3:1
> Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
>
> 摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群。一日，领羊群往野外去，到了　神的山，就是何烈山，


出3:2
> There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.
>
> 耶和华的使者从荆棘里火焰中向摩西显现。摩西观看，不料，荆棘被火烧着，却没有烧毁。


出3:3
> So Moses thought, "I will go over and see this strange sight--why the bush does not burn up."
>
> 摩西说：“我要过去看这大异象，这荆棘为何没有烧坏呢？”


出3:4
> When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, "Moses! Moses!" And Moses said, "Here I am."
>
> 耶和华　神见他过去要看，就从荆棘里呼叫说：“摩西！摩西！”他说：“我在这里。”


出3:5
> "Do not come any closer," God said. "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground."
>
> 神说：“不要近前来，当把你脚上的鞋脱下来，因为你所站之地是圣地。”


出3:6
> Then he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob." At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.
>
> 又说：“我是你父亲的　神，是亚伯拉罕的　神，以撒的　神，雅各的　神。”摩西蒙上脸，因为怕看　神。


出3:7
> The LORD said, "I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering.
>
> 耶和华说：“我的百姓在埃及所受的困苦，我实在看见了；他们因受督工的辖制所发的哀声，我也听见了。我原知道他们的痛苦。


出3:8
> So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey--the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
>
> 我下来是要救他们脱离埃及人的手，领他们出了那地，到美好宽阔流奶与蜜之地，就是到迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人之地。


出3:9
> And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.
>
> 现在以色列人的哀声达到我耳中，我也看见埃及人怎样欺压他们。


出3:10
> So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt."
>
> 故此，我要打发你去见法老，使你可以将我的百姓以色列人从埃及领出来。”


出3:11
> But Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?"
>
> 摩西对　神说：“我是什么人，竟能去见法老，将以色列人从埃及领出来呢？”


出3:12
> And God said, "I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain."
>
> 神说：“我必与你同在。你将百姓从埃及领出来之后，你们必在这山上事奉我，这就是我打发你去的证据。”


出3:13
> Moses said to God, "Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' Then what shall I tell them?"
>
> 摩西对　神说：“我到以色列人那里，对他们说：‘你们祖宗的　神打发我到你们这里来。’他们若问我说：‘他叫什么名字？’我要对他们说什么呢？”


出3:14
> God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: 'I AM has sent me to you.'"
>
> 神对摩西说：“我是自有永有的。”又说：“你要对以色列人这样说：‘那自有的打发我到你们这里来。’”


出3:15
> God also said to Moses, "Say to the Israelites, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers--the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob--has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, the name by which I am to be remembered from generation to generation.
>
> 神又对摩西说：“你要对以色列人这样说：‘耶和华你们祖宗的　神，就是亚伯拉罕的　神，以撒的　神，雅各的　神，打发我到你们这里来。耶和华是我的名，直到永远；这也是我的纪念，直到万代。’


出3:16
> "Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers--the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob--appeared to me and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.
>
> 你去招聚以色列的长老，对他们说：‘耶和华你们祖宗的　神，就是亚伯拉罕的　神，以撒的　神，雅各的　神，向我显现，说：我实在眷顾了你们，我也看见埃及人怎样待你们。


出3:17
> And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites--a land flowing with milk and honey.'
>
> 我也说要将你们从埃及的困苦中领出来，往迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人的地去，就是到流奶与蜜之地。’


出3:18
> "The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God.'
>
> 他们必听你的话。你和以色列的长老要去见埃及王，对他说：‘耶和华希伯来人的　神遇见了我们，现在求你容我们往旷野去，走三天的路程，为要祭祀耶和华我们的　神。’


出3:19
> But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him.
>
> 我知道虽用大能的手，埃及王也不容你们去。


出3:20
> So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go.
>
> 我必伸手在埃及中间施行我一切的奇事，攻击那地，然后他才容你们去。


出3:21
> "And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed.
>
> 我必叫你们在埃及人眼前蒙恩，你们去的时候，就不至于空手而去。


出3:22
> Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians."
>
> 但各妇女必向她的邻舍，并居住在她家里的女人要金器、银器和衣裳，好给你们的儿女穿戴，这样你们就把埃及人的财物夺去了。”


## 出埃及记第4章
出4:1
> Moses answered, "What if they do not believe me or listen to me and say, 'The LORD did not appear to you'?"
>
> 摩西回答说：“他们必不信我，也不听我的话，必说：‘耶和华并没有向你显现！’”


出4:2
> Then the LORD said to him, "What is that in your hand?" "A staff," he replied.
>
> 耶和华对摩西说：“你手里是什么？”他说：“是杖。”


出4:3
> The LORD said, "Throw it on the ground." Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it.
>
> 耶和华说：“丢在地上。”他一丢下去，就变作蛇，摩西便跑开。


出4:4
> Then the LORD said to him, "Reach out your hand and take it by the tail." So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand.
>
> 耶和华对摩西说：“伸出手来拿住它的尾巴，它必在你手中仍变为杖。


出4:5
> "This," said the LORD, "is so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers--the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob--has appeared to you."
>
> 如此好叫他们信耶和华他们祖宗的　神，就是亚伯拉罕的　神，以撒的　神，雅各的　神，是向你显现了。”


出4:6
> Then the LORD said, "Put your hand inside your cloak." So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was leprous, like snow.
>
> 耶和华又对他说：“把手放在怀里。”他就把手放在怀里，及至抽出来，不料，手长了大麻疯，有雪那样白。


出4:7
> "Now put it back into your cloak," he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh.
>
> 耶和华说：“再把手放在怀里。”他就再把手放在怀里，及至从怀里抽出来，不料，手已经复原，与周身的肉一样。


出4:8
> Then the LORD said, "If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first miraculous sign, they may believe the second.
>
> 又说：“倘或他们不听你的话，也不信头一个神迹，他们必信第二个神迹。


出4:9
> But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground."
>
> 这两个神迹若都不信，也不听你的话，你就从河里取些水，倒在旱地上，你从河里取的水必在旱地上变作血。”


出4:10
> Moses said to the LORD, "O Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue."
>
> 摩西对耶和华说：“主啊，我素日不是能言的人，就是从你对仆人说话以后，也是这样，我本是拙口笨舌的。”


出4:11
> The LORD said to him, "Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the LORD?
>
> 耶和华对他说：“谁造人的口呢？谁使人口哑、耳聋、目明、眼瞎呢？岂不是我耶和华吗？


出4:12
> Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say."
>
> 现在去吧！我必赐你口才，指教你所当说的话。”


出4:13
> But Moses said, "O Lord, please send someone else to do it."
>
> 摩西说：“主啊，你愿意打发谁，就打发谁去吧！”


出4:14
> Then the LORD'S anger burned against Moses and he said, "What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and his heart will be glad when he sees you.
>
> 耶和华向摩西发怒说：“不是有你的哥哥利未人亚伦吗？我知道他是能言的，现在他出来迎接你，他一见你，心里就欢喜。


出4:15
> You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do.
>
> 你要将当说的话传给他；我也要赐你和他口才，又要指教你们所当行的事。


出4:16
> He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him.
>
> 他要替你对百姓说话；你要以他当作口，他要以你当作　神。


出4:17
> But take this staff in your hand so you can perform miraculous signs with it."
>
> 你手里要拿这杖，好行神迹。”


出4:18
> Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, "Let me go back to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive." Jethro said, "Go, and I wish you well."
>
> 于是摩西回到他岳父叶忒罗那里，对他说：“求你容我回去见我在埃及的弟兄，看他们还在不在。”叶忒罗对摩西说：“你可以平平安安地去吧！”


出4:19
> Now the LORD had said to Moses in Midian, "Go back to Egypt, for all the men who wanted to kill you are dead."
>
> 耶和华在米甸对摩西说：“你要回埃及去，因为寻索你命的人都死了。”


出4:20
> So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand.
>
> 摩西就带着妻子和两个儿子，叫他们骑上驴，回埃及地去。摩西手里拿着　神的杖。


出4:21
> The LORD said to Moses, "When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.
>
> 耶和华对摩西说：“你回到埃及的时候要留意，将我指示你的一切奇事，行在法老面前，但我要使（或作“任凭”。下同）他的心刚硬，他必不容百姓去。


出4:22
> Then say to Pharaoh, 'This is what the LORD says: Israel is my firstborn son,
>
> 你要对法老说：‘耶和华这样说：以色列是我的儿子，我的长子。


出4:23
> and I told you, "Let my son go, so he may worship me." But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.'"
>
> 我对你说过，容我的儿子去，好事奉我，你还是不肯容他去。看哪！我要杀你的长子。’”


出4:24
> At a lodging place on the way, the LORD met Moses and was about to kill him.
>
> 摩西在路上住宿的地方，耶和华遇见他，想要杀他。


出4:25
> But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son's foreskin and touched Moses'feet with it. "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me," she said.
>
> 西坡拉就拿一块火石，割下他儿子的阳皮，丢在摩西脚前，说：“你真是我的血郎了。”


出4:26
> So the LORD let him alone. (At that time she said "bridegroom of blood," referring to circumcision.)
>
> 这样耶和华才放了他。西坡拉说：“你因割礼就是血郎了。”


出4:27
> The LORD said to Aaron, "Go into the desert to meet Moses." So he met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him.
>
> 耶和华对亚伦说：“你往旷野去迎接摩西。”他就去，在　神的山遇见摩西，和他亲嘴。


出4:28
> Then Moses told Aaron everything the LORD had sent him to say, and also about all the miraculous signs he had commanded him to perform.
>
> 摩西将耶和华打发他所说的言语和嘱咐他所行的神迹，都告诉了亚伦。


出4:29
> Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites,
>
> 摩西、亚伦就去招聚以色列的众长老。


出4:30
> and Aaron told them everything the LORD had said to Moses. He also performed the signs before the people,
>
> 亚伦将耶和华对摩西所说的一切话述说了一遍，又在百姓眼前行了那些神迹，


出4:31
> and they believed. And when they heard that the LORD was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped.
>
> 百姓就信了。以色列人听见耶和华眷顾他们，鉴察他们的困苦，就低头下拜。


## 出埃及记第5章
出5:1
> Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the desert.'"
>
> 后来摩西、亚伦去对法老说：“耶和华以色列的　神这样说：‘容我的百姓去，在旷野向我守节。’”


出5:2
> Pharaoh said, "Who is the LORD, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD and I will not let Israel go."
>
> 法老说：“耶和华是谁，使我听他的话，容以色列人去呢？我不认识耶和华，也不容以色列人去。”


出5:3
> Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword."
>
> 他们说：“希伯来人的　神遇见了我们，求你容我们往旷野去，走三天的路程，祭祀耶和华我们的　神，免得他用瘟疫、刀兵攻击我们。”


出5:4
> But the king of Egypt said, "Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!"
>
> 埃及王对他们说：“摩西、亚伦，你们为什么叫百姓旷工呢？你们去担你们的担子吧！”


出5:5
> Then Pharaoh said, "Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working."
>
> 又说：“看哪，这地的以色列人如今众多，你们竟叫他们歇下担子！”


出5:6
> That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and foremen in charge of the people:
>
> 当天，法老吩咐督工的和官长说：


出5:7
> "You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw.
>
> “你们不可照常把草给百姓作砖，叫他们自己去捡草。


出5:8
> But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don't reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'
>
> 他们素常作砖的数目，你们仍旧向他们要，一点不可减少！因为他们是懒惰的，所以呼求说：‘容我们去祭祀我们的　神。’


出5:9
> Make the work harder for the men so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies."
>

出10:7
> Pharaoh's officials said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the LORD their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?"
>
> 法老的臣仆对法老说：“这人为我们的网罗要到几时呢？容这些人去，事奉耶和华他们的　神吧！埃及已经败坏了，你还不知道吗？”


出10:8
> Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. "Go, worship the LORD your God," he said. "But just who will be going?"
>
> 于是摩西、亚伦被召回来见法老，法老对他们说：“你们去事奉耶和华你们的　神，但那要去的是谁呢？”

> Moses answered, "We will go with our young and old, with our sons and daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival to the LORD."
>
> 摩西说：“我们要和我们老的少的、儿子女儿同去，且把羊群牛群一同带去，因为我们务要向耶和华守节。”


出10:10
> Pharaoh said, "The LORD be with you--if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly you are bent on evil.

> 因为这蝗虫遮满地面，甚至地都黑暗了，又吃地上一切的菜蔬和冰雹所剩树上的果子。埃及遍地，无论是树木，是田间的菜蔬，连一点青的也没有留下。


出10:16
> Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you.

> 摩西说：“你总要把祭物和燔祭牲交给我们，使我们可以祭祀耶和华我们的　神。


出10:26
> Our livestock too must go with us; not a hoof is to be left behind. We have to use some of them in worshiping the LORD our God, and until we get there we will not know what we are to use to worship the LORD."
>
> 我们的牲畜也要带去，连一蹄也不留下，因为我们要从其中取出来，事奉耶和华我们的　神。我们未到那里，还不知道用什么事奉耶和华。”


出10:27

>
> 但耶和华使法老的心刚硬，不肯容他们去。


出10:28
> Pharaoh said to Moses, "Get out of my sight! Make sure you do not appear before me again! The day you see my face you will die."
