I"¦<p>As I stated in my last post, my first task for this week was to work on the gameâ€™s UI, starting with the gameâ€™s main menu. I have a lot of experience making simple menus for my other game projects in the past.
All the ones Iâ€™ve made before were quite static: A simple background image, with buttons that you could only click, not highlight. I couldâ€™ve recycled one of my older menus, but I decided that I wanted to challenge myself
and create a quality UI from the get-go, one that was vibrant and constantly in motion. I took note of the main menu I saw in <a href="https://youtu.be/e8SRYnCkz7s">Sonic CD</a>, a game I played through recently, this was the kind of
menu I wanted to emulate. I didnâ€™t want the menu options to stay static either, I wanted to get them scrolling according to the playerâ€™s input. When I wasnâ€™t precoccupied with other aspects of the project, this was my primary
challenge this week.</p>
