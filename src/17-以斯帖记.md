>
> 这日子满了，又为所有住书珊城的大小人民，在御园的院子里设摆筵席七日。

> Wine was served in goblets of gold, each one different from the other, and the royal wine was abundant, in keeping with the king's liberality.
>
> 用金器皿赐酒，器皿各有不同。御酒甚多，足显王的厚意。


斯1:8
> By the king's command each guest was allowed to drink in his own way, for the king instructed all the wine stewards to serve each man what he wished.
>
> 喝酒有例，不准勉强人，因王吩咐宫里的一切臣宰，让人各随己意。


斯1:9
> Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes.
>
> 王后瓦实提在亚哈随鲁王的宫内，也为妇女设摆筵席。


斯1:10
> On the seventh day, when King Xerxes was in high spirits from wine, he commanded the seven eunuchs who served him--Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Carcas--
>
> 第七日，亚哈随鲁王饮酒，心中快乐，就吩咐在他面前侍立的七个太监米户幔、比斯他、哈波拿、比革他、亚拔他、西达、甲迦，


斯1:11
> to bring before him Queen Vashti, wearing her royal crown, in order to display her beauty to the people and nobles, for she was lovely to look at.
>
> 请王后瓦实提头戴王后的冠冕到王面前，使各等臣民看她的美貌，因为她容貌甚美。


斯1:12
> But when the attendants delivered the king's command, Queen Vashti refused to come. Then the king became furious and burned with anger.
>
> 王后瓦实提却不肯遵太监所传的王命而来，所以王甚发怒，心如火烧。


斯1:13
> Since it was customary for the king to consult experts in matters of law and justice, he spoke with the wise men who understood the times
>
> 那时，在王左右常见王面，国中坐高位的，有波斯和玛代的七个大臣，就是甲示拿，示达，押玛他，他施斯，米力，玛西拿，米母干，

> and were closest to the king--Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, the seven nobles of Persia and Media who had special access to the king and were highest in the kingdom.
>
> 都是达时务的明哲人。按王的常规，办事必先询问知例明法的人。王问他们说，


斯1:15
> "According to law, what must be done to Queen Vashti?" he asked. "She has not obeyed the command of King Xerxes that the eunuchs have taken to her."
>
> “王后瓦实提不遵太监所传的王命，照例应当怎样办理呢？”


斯1:16
> Then Memucan replied in the presence of the king and the nobles, "Queen Vashti has done wrong, not only against the king but also against all the nobles and the peoples of all the provinces of King Xerxes.
>
> 米母干在王和众首领面前回答说：“王后瓦实提这事不但得罪王，并且有害于王各省的臣民。


斯1:17
> For the queen's conduct will become known to all the women, and so they will despise their husbands and say, 'King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she would not come.'
>
> 因为王后这事必传到众妇人的耳中，说亚哈随鲁王吩咐王后瓦实提到王面前，她却不来。她们就藐视自己的丈夫。


斯1:18
> This very day the Persian and Median women of the nobility who have heard about the queen's conduct will respond to all the king's nobles in the same way. There will be no end of disrespect and discord.
>
> 今日，波斯和玛代的众夫人听见王后这事，必向王的大臣照样行，从此必大开藐视和忿怒之端。


斯1:19
> "Therefore, if it pleases the king, let him issue a royal decree and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes. Also let the king give her royal position to someone else who is better than she.
>
> 王若以为美，就降旨写在波斯和玛代人的例中，永不更改，不准瓦实提再到王面前，将她王后的位分赐给比她还好的人。


斯1:20
> Then when the king's edict is proclaimed throughout all his vast realm, all the women will respect their husbands, from the least to the greatest."
>
> 所降的旨意传遍通国（国度本来广大），所有的妇人，无论丈夫贵贱都必尊敬他。”


斯1:21
> The king and his nobles were pleased with this advice, so the king did as Memucan proposed.
>
> 王和众首领都以米母干的话为美，王就照这话去行。


斯1:22

斯2:1
> Later when the anger of King Xerxes had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what he had decreed about her.
>
> 这事以后，亚哈随鲁王的忿怒止息，就想念瓦实提和她所行的，并怎样降旨办她。


斯2:2
> Then the king's personal attendants proposed, "Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king.
>
> 于是王的侍臣对王说：“不如为王寻找美貌的处女。


斯2:3
> Let the king appoint commissioners in every province of his realm to bring all these beautiful girls into the harem at the citadel of Susa. Let them be placed under the care of Hegai, the king's eunuch, who is in charge of the women; and let beauty treatments be given to them.
>
> 王可以派官在国中的各省，招聚美貌的处女到书珊城（或作“宫”）的女院，交给掌管女子的太监希该，给她们当用的香品。


斯2:4
> Then let the girl who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti." This advice appealed to the king, and he followed it.
>
> 王所喜爱的女子可以立为王后，代替瓦实提。”王以这事为美，就如此行。


斯2:5
> Now there was in the citadel of Susa a Jew of the tribe of Benjamin, named Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish,
>
> 书珊城有一个犹大人，名叫末底改，是便雅悯人基士的曾孙、示每的孙子、睚珥的儿子。


斯2:6
> who had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, among those taken captive with Jehoiachin king of Judah.
>
> 从前巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒将犹大王耶哥尼雅（又名“约雅斤”）和百姓从耶路撒冷掳去，末底改也在其内。


斯2:7
> Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah, whom he had brought up because she had neither father nor mother. This girl, who was also known as Esther, was lovely in form and features, and Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter when her father and mother died.
>
> 末底改抚养他叔叔的女儿哈大沙（后名以斯帖），因为她没有父母。这女子又容貌俊美，她父母死了，末底改就收她为自己的女儿。


斯2:8
> When the king's order and edict had been proclaimed, many girls were brought to the citadel of Susa and put under the care of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the king's palace and entrusted to Hegai, who had charge of the harem.
>
> 王的谕旨传出，就招聚许多女子到书珊城，交给掌管女子的希该；以斯帖也送入王宫，交付希该。


斯2:9
> The girl pleased him and won his favor. Immediately he provided her with her beauty treatments and special food. He assigned to her seven maids selected from the king's palace and moved her and her maids into the best place in the harem.
>
> 希该喜悦以斯帖，就恩待她，急忙给她需用的香品和她所当得的份，又派所当得的七个宫女服事她，使她和她的宫女搬入女院上好的房屋。


斯2:10
> Esther had not revealed her nationality and family background, because Mordecai had forbidden her to do so.
>
> 以斯帖未曾将籍贯宗族告诉人，因为末底改嘱咐她不可叫人知道。


斯2:11
> Every day he walked back and forth near the courtyard of the harem to find out how Esther was and what was happening to her.
>
> 末底改天天在女院前边行走，要知道以斯帖平安不平安，并后事如何。


斯2:12
> Before a girl's turn came to go in to King Xerxes, she had to complete twelve months of beauty treatments prescribed for the women, six months with oil of myrrh and six with perfumes and cosmetics.
>
> 众女子照例先洁净身体十二个月：六个月用没药油，六个月用香料和洁身之物。满了日期，然后挨次进去见亚哈随鲁王。


斯2:13
> And this is how she would go to the king: Anything she wanted was given her to take with her from the harem to the king's palace.
>
> 女子进去见王是这样：从女院到王宫的时候，凡她所要的都必给她。


斯2:14
> In the evening she would go there and in the morning return to another part of the harem to the care of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not return to the king unless he was pleased with her and summoned her by name.
>
> 晚上进去，次日回到女子第二院，交给掌管妃嫔的太监沙甲；除非王喜爱她，再提名召她，就不再进去见王。


斯2:15
> When the turn came for Esther (the girl Mordecai had adopted, the daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go to the king, she asked for nothing other than what Hegai, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the harem, suggested. And Esther won the favor of everyone who saw her.
>
> 末底改叔叔亚比孩的女儿，就是末底改收为自己女儿的以斯帖，按次序当进去见王的时候，除了掌管女子的太监希该所派定给她的，她别无所求。凡看见以斯帖的都喜悦她。


斯2:16
> She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal residence in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
>
> 亚哈随鲁王第七年十月，就是提别月，以斯帖被引入宫见王。


斯2:17
> Now the king was attracted to Esther more than to any of the other women, and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins. So he set a royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.
>
> 王爱以斯帖过于爱众女，她在王眼前蒙宠爱比众处女更甚。王就把王后的冠冕戴在她头上，立她为王后，代替瓦实提。


斯2:18
> And the king gave a great banquet, Esther's banquet, for all his nobles and officials. He proclaimed a holiday throughout the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality.
>
> 王因以斯帖的缘故给众首领和臣仆设摆大筵席，又豁免各省的租税，并照王的厚意大颁赏赐。


斯2:19
> When the virgins were assembled a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate.
>
> 第二次招聚处女的时候，末底改坐在朝门。


斯2:20
> But Esther had kept secret her family background and nationality just as Mordecai had told her to do, for she continued to follow Mordecai's instructions as she had done when he was bringing her up.
>
> 以斯帖照着末底改所嘱咐的，还没有将籍贯宗族告诉人，因为以斯帖遵末底改的命，如抚养她的时候一样。


斯2:21
> During the time Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's officers who guarded the doorway, became angry and conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.
>
> 当那时候，末底改坐在朝门，王的太监中有两个守门的辟探和提列，恼恨亚哈随鲁王，想要下手害他。


斯2:22
> But Mordecai found out about the plot and told Queen Esther, who in turn reported it to the king, giving credit to Mordecai.
>
> 末底改知道了，就告诉王后以斯帖。以斯帖奉末底改的名，报告于王。


斯2:23
> And when the report was investigated and found to be true, the two officials were hanged on a gallows. All this was recorded in the book of the annals in the presence of the king.
>
> 究察这事，果然是实，就把二人挂在木头上，将这事在王面前写于历史上。

>
> 这事以后，亚哈随鲁王抬举亚甲族哈米大他的儿子哈曼，使他高升，叫他的爵位超过与他同事的一切臣宰。


斯3:2
> All the royal officials at the king's gate knelt down and paid honor to Haman, for the king had commanded this concerning him. But Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor.
>
> 在朝门的一切臣仆，都跪拜哈曼，因为王如此吩咐；惟独末底改不跪不拜。


斯3:3
> Then the royal officials at the king's gate asked Mordecai, "Why do you disobey the king's command?"
>
> 在朝门的臣仆问末底改说：“你为何违背王的命令呢？”


斯3:4
> Day after day they spoke to him but he refused to comply. Therefore they told Haman about it to see whether Mordecai's behavior would be tolerated, for he had told them he was a Jew.
>
> 他们天天劝他，他还是不听。他们就告诉哈曼，要看末底改的事站得住站不住，因他已经告诉他们自己是犹大人。


斯3:5
> When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor, he was enraged.
>
> 哈曼见末底改不跪不拜，他就怒气填胸。


斯3:6
> Yet having learned who Mordecai's people were, he scorned the idea of killing only Mordecai. Instead Haman looked for a way to destroy all Mordecai's people, the Jews, throughout the whole kingdom of Xerxes.
>
> 他们已将末底改的本族告诉哈曼。他以为下手害末底改一人是小事，就要灭绝亚哈随鲁王通国所有的犹大人，就是末底改的本族。


斯3:7
> In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, in the first month, the month of Nisan, they cast the pur  (that is, the lot) in the presence of Haman to select a day and month. And the lot fell on the twelfth month, the month of Adar.
>
> 亚哈随鲁王十二年正月，就是尼散月，人在哈曼面前，按日日月月掣普珥，就是掣签，要定何月何日为吉，择定了十二月，就是亚达月。


斯3:8
> Then Haman said to King Xerxes, "There is a certain people dispersed and scattered among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom whose customs are different from those of all other people and who do not obey the king's laws; it is not in the king's best interest to tolerate them.
>
> 哈曼对亚哈随鲁王说：“有一种民，散居在王国各省的民中。他们的律例与万民的律例不同，也不守王的律例，所以容留他们与王无益。


斯3:9
> If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued to destroy them, and I will put ten thousand talents of silver into the royal treasury for the men who carry out this business."
>
> 王若以为美，请下旨意灭绝他们；我就捐一万他连得银子，交给掌管国帑的人，纳入王的府库。”


斯3:10
> So the king took his signet ring from his finger and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.
>
> 于是，王从自己手上摘下戒指，给犹大人的仇敌、亚甲族哈米大他的儿子哈曼。


斯3:11
> "Keep the money," the king said to Haman, "and do with the people as you please."
>
> 王对哈曼说：“这银子仍赐给你，这民也交给你，你可以随意待他们。”


斯3:12
> Then on the thirteenth day of the first month the royal secretaries were summoned. They wrote out in the script of each province and in the language of each people all Haman's orders to the king's satraps, the governors of the various provinces and the nobles of the various peoples. These were written in the name of King Xerxes himself and sealed with his own ring.
>
> 正月十三日，就召了王的书记来，照着哈曼一切所吩咐的，用各省的文字、各族的方言，奉亚哈随鲁王的名写旨意，传与总督和各省的省长，并各族的首领。又用王的戒指盖印，


斯3:13
> Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces with the order to destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews--young and old, women and little children--on a single day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods.
>
> 交给驿卒传到王的各省，吩咐将犹大人，无论老少妇女孩子，在一日之间，十二月，就是亚达月十三日，全然剪除，杀戮灭绝，并夺他们的财为掠物。


斯3:14
> A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so they would be ready for that day.
>
> 抄录这旨意，颁行各省，宣告各族，使他们预备等候那日。


斯3:15
> Spurred on by the king's command, the couriers went out, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was bewildered.
>
> 驿卒奉王命急忙起行，旨意也传遍书珊城。王同哈曼坐下饮酒，书珊城的民，却都慌乱。


## 以斯帖记第4章
斯4:1
> When Mordecai learned of all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the city, wailing loudly and bitterly.
>
> 末底改知道所做的这一切事，就撕裂衣服，穿麻衣，蒙灰尘，在城中行走，痛哭哀号。


斯4:2
> But he went only as far as the king's gate, because no one clothed in sackcloth was allowed to enter it.
>
> 到了朝门前停住脚步，因为穿麻衣的不可进朝门。


斯4:3
> In every province to which the edict and order of the king came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping and wailing. Many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
>
> 王的谕旨所到的各省各处，犹大人大大悲哀，禁食哭泣哀号，穿麻衣躺在灰中的甚多。


斯4:4
> When Esther's maids and eunuchs came and told her about Mordecai, she was in great distress. She sent clothes for him to put on instead of his sackcloth, but he would not accept them.
>
> 王后以斯帖的宫女和太监来把这事告诉以斯帖，她甚是忧愁，就送衣服给末底改穿，要他脱下麻衣，他却不受。


斯4:5
> Then Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs assigned to attend her, and ordered him to find out what was troubling Mordecai and why.
>
> 以斯帖就把王所派伺候她的一个太监，名叫哈他革召来，吩咐他去见末底改，要知道这是什么事，是什么缘故。


斯4:6
> So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king's gate.
>
> 于是，哈他革出到朝门前的宽阔处见末底改。


斯4:7
> Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him, including the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews.
>
> 末底改将自己所遇的事，并哈曼为灭绝犹大人，应许捐入王库的银数，都告诉了他。


斯4:8
> He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict for their annihilation, which had been published in Susa, to show to Esther and explain it to her, and he told him to urge her to go into the king's presence to beg for mercy and plead with him for her people.
>
> 又将所抄写传遍书珊城要灭绝犹大人的旨意交给哈他革，要给以斯帖看，又要给她说明，并嘱咐她进去见王，为本族的人在王面前恳切祈求。


斯4:9
> Hathach went back and reported to Esther what Mordecai had said.
>
> 哈他革回来，将末底改的话告诉以斯帖。


斯4:10
> Then she instructed him to say to Mordecai,
>
> 以斯帖就吩咐哈他革去见末底改说：“


斯4:11
> "All the king's officials and the people of the royal provinces know that for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned the king has but one law: that he be put to death. The only exception to this is for the king to extend the gold scepter to him and spare his life. But thirty days have passed since I was called to go to the king."
>
> 王的一切臣仆和各省的人民，都知道有一个定例：若不蒙召，擅入内院见王的，无论男女必被治死；除非王向他伸出金杖，不得存活。现在我没有蒙召进去见王已经三十日了。”


斯4:12
> When Esther's words were reported to Mordecai,
>
> 人就把以斯帖这话告诉末底改。


斯4:13
> he sent back this answer: "Do not think that because you are in the king's house you alone of all the Jews will escape.
>
> 末底改托人回覆以斯帖说：“你莫想在王宫里强过一切犹大人，得免这祸。


斯4:14
> For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father's family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this?"
>
> 此时你若闭口不言，犹大人必从别处得解脱、蒙拯救；你和你父家必至灭亡。焉知你得了王后的位分，不是为现今的机会吗？”


斯4:15
> Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai:
>
> 以斯帖就吩咐人回报末底改说：


斯4:16
> "Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish."
>
> “你当去招聚书珊城所有的犹大人，为我禁食三昼三夜，不吃不喝；我和我的宫女也要这样禁食。然后我违例进去见王，我若死就死吧！”


斯4:17
> So Mordecai went away and carried out all of Esther's instructions.
>
> 于是，末底改照以斯帖一切所吩咐的去行。


## 以斯帖记第5章

>
> 以斯帖说：“王若以为美，就请王带着哈曼今日赴我所预备的筵席。”

>
> 王说：“叫哈曼速速照以斯帖的话去行。”于是，王带着哈曼赴以斯帖所预备的筵席。

斯5:11
> Haman boasted to them about his vast wealth, his many sons, and all the ways the king had honored him and how he had elevated him above the other nobles and officials.
>
> 哈曼将他富厚的荣耀，众多的儿女，和王抬举他使他超乎首领臣仆之上，都述说给他们听。


斯5:12
> "And that's not all," Haman added. "I'm the only person Queen Esther invited to accompany the king to the banquet she gave. And she has invited me along with the king tomorrow.
>
> 哈曼又说：“王后以斯帖预备筵席，除了我之外，不许别人随王赴席。明日王后又请我随王赴席；


斯5:13
> But all this gives me no satisfaction as long as I see that Jew Mordecai sitting at the king's gate."
>
> 只是我见犹大人末底改坐在朝门，虽有这一切荣耀，也与我无益。”


斯5:14
> His wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, "Have a gallows built, seventy-five feet high, and ask the king in the morning to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then go with the king to the dinner and be happy." This suggestion delighted Haman, and he had the gallows built.
>
> 他的妻细利斯和他一切的朋友对他说：“不如立一个五丈高的木架，明日求王将末底改挂在其上，然后你可以欢欢喜喜地随王赴席。”哈曼以这话为美，就叫人做了木架。
