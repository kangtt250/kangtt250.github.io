Now then, you and all these people, get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give to them–to the Israelites.<p>“我的仆人摩西死了。现在你要起来，和众百姓过这约旦河，往我所要赐给以色列人的地去。</blockquote><p>书1:3<blockquote><p>I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses.<p>凡你们脚掌所踏之地，我都照着我所应许摩西的话赐给你们了。</blockquote><p>书1:4<blockquote><p>Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the great river, the Euphrates–all the Hittite country–to the Great Sea on the west.<p>从旷野和这黎巴嫩，直到伯拉大河，赫人的全地，又到大海日落之处，都要作你们的境界。</blockquote><p>书1:5<blockquote><p>No one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you.<p>你平生的日子，必无一人能在你面前站立得住。我怎样与摩西同在，也必照样与你同在；我必不撇下你，也不丢弃你。</blockquote><p>书1:6<blockquote><p>“Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their forefathers to give them.<p>“你当刚强壮胆！因为你必使这百姓承受那地为业，就是我向他们列祖起誓应许赐给他们的地。</blockquote><p>书1:7<blockquote><p>Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go.<p>只要刚强，大大壮胆，谨守遵行我仆人摩西所吩咐你的一切律法，不可偏离左右，使你无论往哪里去，都可以顺利。</blockquote><p>书1:8<blockquote><p>Do not let this Book of the Law depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.<p>这律法书不可离开你的口，总要昼夜思想，好使你谨守遵行这书上所写的一切话。如此，你的道路就可以亨通，凡事顺利。</blockquote><p>书1:9<blockquote><p>Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go.”<p>我岂没有吩咐你吗？你当刚强壮胆！不要惧怕，也不要惊惶，因为你无论往哪里去，耶和华你的　神必与你同在。”</blockquote><p>书1:10<blockquote><p>So Joshua ordered the officers of the people:<p>于是，约书亚吩咐百姓的官长说：</blockquote><p>书1:11<blockquote><p>“Go through the camp and tell the people, ‘Get your supplies ready. Three days from now you will cross the Jordan here to go in and take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving you for your own.’”<p>“你们要走遍营中，吩咐百姓说：‘当预备食物；因为三日之内，你们要过这约旦河，进去得耶和华你们　神赐你们为业之地。’”</blockquote><p>书1:12<blockquote><p>But to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,<p>约书亚对流便人、迦得人和玛拿西半支派的人说：</blockquote><p>书1:13<blockquote><p>“Remember the command that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you: ‘The LORD your God is giving you rest and has granted you this land.’<p>“你们要追念耶和华的仆人摩西所吩咐你们的话说：‘耶和华你们的　神使你们得享平安，也必将这地赐给你们’。</blockquote><p>书1:14<blockquote><p>Your wives, your children and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan, but all your fighting men, fully armed, must cross over ahead of your brothers. You are to help your brothers<p>你们的妻子、孩子和牲畜都可以留在约旦河东摩西所给你们的地；但你们中间一切大能的勇士都要带着兵器，在你们的弟兄前面过去，帮助他们。</blockquote><p>书1:15<blockquote><p>until the LORD gives them rest, as he has done for you, and until they too have taken possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving them. After that, you may go back and occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you east of the Jordan toward the sunrise.”<p>等到耶和华使你们的弟兄像你们一样得享平安，并且得着耶和华你们　神所赐他们为业之地，那时才可以回你们所得之地，承受为业，就是耶和华的仆人摩西在约旦河东、向日出之地所给你们的。”</blockquote><p>书1:16<blockquote><p>Then they answered Joshua, “Whatever you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.<p>他们回答约书亚说：“你所吩咐我们行的，我们都必行；你所差遣我们去的，我们都必去。</blockquote><p>书1:17<blockquote><p>Just as we fully obeyed Moses, so we will obey you. Only may the LORD your God be with you as he was with Moses.<p>我们从前在一切事上怎样听从摩西，现在也必照样听从你；惟愿耶和华你的　神与你同在，像与摩西同在一样。</blockquote><p>书1:18<blockquote><p>Whoever rebels against your word and does not obey your words, whatever you may command them, will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous!”<p>无论什么人违背你的命令，不听从你所吩咐他的一切话，就必治死他。你只要刚强壮胆！”</blockquote><h2 id="约书亚记第2章">约书亚记第2章</h2><p>书2:1<blockquote><p>Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Shittim. “Go, look over the land,” he said, “especially Jericho.” So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there.<p>当下，嫩的儿子约书亚从什亭暗暗打发两个人作探子，吩咐说：“你们去窥探那地和耶利哥。”于是二人去了，来到一个妓女名叫喇合的家里，就在那里躺卧。</blockquote><p>书2:2<blockquote><p>The king of Jericho was told, “Look! Some of the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land.”<p>有人告诉耶利哥王说：“今夜有以色列人来到这里窥探此地。”</blockquote><p>书2:3<blockquote><p>So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab: “Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, because they have come to spy out the whole land.”<p>耶利哥王打发人去见喇合说：“那来到你这里、进了你家的人要交出来，因为他们来窥探全地。”</blockquote><p>书2:4<blockquote><p>But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. She said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they had come from.<p>女人将二人隐藏，就回答说：“那人果然到我这里来，他们是哪里来的我却不知道。</blockquote><p>书2:5<blockquote><p>At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, the men left. I don’t know which way they went. Go after them quickly. You may catch up with them.”<p>天黑、要关城门的时候，他们出去了，往哪里去我却不知道。你们快快地去追赶，就必追上。”</blockquote><p>书2:6<blockquote><p>(But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax she had laid out on the roof.)<p>（先是女人领二人上了房顶，将他们藏在那里所摆的麻秸中。）</blockquote><p>书2:7<blockquote><p>So the men set out in pursuit of the spies on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.<p>那些人就往约旦河的渡口追赶他们去了。追赶他们的人一出去，城门就关了。</blockquote><p>书2:8<blockquote><p>Before the spies lay down for the night, she went up on the roof<p>二人还没有躺卧，女人就上房顶，到他们那里，</blockquote><p>书2:9<blockquote><p>and said to them, “I know that the LORD has given this land to you and that a great fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you.<p>对他们说：“我知道耶和华已经把这地赐给你们，并且因你们的缘故我们都惊慌了。这地的一切居民在你们面前心都消化了，</blockquote><p>书2:10<blockquote><p>We have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan, whom you completely destroyed.<p>因为我们听见你们出埃及的时候，耶和华怎样在你们前面使红海的水干了，并且你们怎样待约旦河东的两个亚摩利王西宏和噩，将他们尽行毁灭。</blockquote><p>书2:11<blockquote><p>When we heard of it, our hearts melted and everyone’s courage failed because of you, for the LORD your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below.<p>我们一听见这些事，心就消化了。因你们的缘故，并无一人有胆气。耶和华你们的　神，本是上天下地的　神。</blockquote><p>书2:12<blockquote><p>Now then, please swear to me by the LORD that you will show kindness to my family, because I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign<p>现在我既是恩待你们，求你们指着耶和华向我起誓，也要恩待我父家，并给我一个实在的证据，</blockquote><p>书2:13<blockquote><p>that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and that you will save us from death.”<p>要救活我的父母、弟兄、姐妹和一切属他们的，拯救我们性命不死。”</blockquote><p>书2:14<blockquote><p>“Our lives for your lives!” the men assured her. “If you don’t tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the LORD gives us the land.”<p>二人对她说：“你若不泄漏我们这件事，我们情愿替你们死。耶和华将这地赐给我们的时候，我们必以慈爱诚实待你。”</blockquote><p>书2:15<blockquote><p>So she let them down by a rope through the window, for the house she lived in was part of the city wall.<p>于是，女人用绳子将二人从窗户里缒下去，因她的房子是在城墙边上，她也住在城墙上。</blockquote><p>书2:16<blockquote><p>Now she had said to them, “Go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there three days until they return, and then go on your way.”<p>她对他们说：“你们且往山上去，恐怕追赶的人碰见你们。要在那里隐藏三天，等追赶的人回来，然后才可以走你们的路。”</blockquote><p>书2:17<blockquote><p>The men said to her, “This oath you made us swear will not be binding on us<p>二人对她说：“你要这样行。不然，你叫我们所起的誓就与我们无干了。</blockquote><p>书2:18<blockquote><p>unless, when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you have brought your father and mother, your brothers and all your family into your house.<p>我们来到这地的时候，你要把这条朱红线绳系在缒我们下去的窗户上，并要使你的父母、弟兄和你父的全家都聚集在你家中。</blockquote><p>书2:19<blockquote><p>If anyone goes outside your house into the street, his blood will be on his own head; we will not be responsible. As for anyone who is in the house with you, his blood will be on our head if a hand is laid on him.<p>凡出了你家门往街上去的，他的罪（原文作“血”）必归到自己的头上，与我们无干了。凡在你家里的，若有人下手害他，流他血的罪就归到我们的头上。</blockquote><p>书2:20<blockquote><p>But if you tell what we are doing, we will be released from the oath you made us swear.”<p>你若泄漏我们这件事，你叫我们所起的誓就与我们无干了。”</blockquote><p>书2:21<blockquote><p>“Agreed,” she replied. “Let it be as you say.” So she sent them away and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window.<p>女人说：“照你们的话行吧！”于是打发他们去了，又把朱红线绳系在窗户上。</blockquote><p>书2:22<blockquote><p>When they left, they went into the hills and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned without finding them.<p>二人到山上，在那里住了三天，等着追赶的人回去了。追赶的人一路找他们，却找不着。</blockquote><p>书2:23<blockquote><p>Then the two men started back. They went down out of the hills, forded the river and came to Joshua son of Nun and told him everything that had happened to them.<p>二人就下山回来，过了河，到嫩的儿子约书亚那里，向他述说所遭遇的一切事。</blockquote><p>书2:24<blockquote><p>They said to Joshua, “The LORD has surely given the whole land into our hands; all the people are melting in fear because of us.”<p>又对约书亚说：“耶和华果然将那全地交在我们手中，那地的一切居民在我们面前心都消化了。”</blockquote><h2 id="约书亚记第3章">约书亚记第3章</h2><p>书3:1<blockquote><p>Early in the morning Joshua and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and went to the Jordan, where they camped before crossing over.<p>约书亚清早起来，和以色列众人都离开什亭，来到约旦河，就住在那里，等候过河。</blockquote><p>书3:2<blockquote><p>After three days the officers went throughout the camp,<p>过了三天，官长走遍营中，</blockquote><p>书3:3<blockquote><p>giving orders to the people: “When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests, who are Levites, carrying it, you are to move out from your positions and follow it.<p>吩咐百姓说：“你们看见耶和华你们　神的约柜，又见祭司利未人抬着，就要离开所住的地方，跟着约柜去。</blockquote><p>书3:4<blockquote><p>Then you will know which way to go, since you have never been this way before. But keep a distance of about a thousand yards between you and the ark; do not go near it.”<p>只是你们和约柜相离，要量二千肘，不可与约柜相近，使你们知道所当走的路，因为这条路你们向来没有走过。”</blockquote><p>书3:5<blockquote><p>Joshua told the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do amazing things among you.”<p>约书亚吩咐百姓说：“你们要自洁，因为明天耶和华必在你们中间行奇事。”</blockquote><p>书3:6<blockquote><p>Joshua said to the priests, “Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on ahead of the people.” So they took it up and went ahead of them.<p>约书亚又吩咐祭司说：“你们抬起约柜，在百姓前头过去。”于是他们抬起约柜，在百姓前头走。</blockquote><p>书3:7<blockquote><p>And the LORD said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to exalt you in the eyes of all Israel, so they may know that I am with you as I was with Moses.<p>耶和华对约书亚说：“从今日起，我必使你在以色列众人眼前尊大，使他们知道我怎样与摩西同在，也必照样与你同在。</blockquote><p>书3:8<blockquote><p>Tell the priests who carry the ark of the covenant: ‘When you reach the edge of the Jordan’s waters, go and stand in the river.’”<p>你要吩咐抬约柜的祭司说：‘你们到了约旦河的水边上，就要在约旦河水里站住。’”</blockquote><p>书3:9<blockquote><p>Joshua said to the Israelites, “Come here and listen to the words of the LORD your God.<p>约书亚对以色列人说：“你们近前来，听耶和华你们　神的话。”</blockquote><p>书3:10<blockquote><p>This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that he will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites and Jebusites.<p>约书亚说：“看哪！普天下主的约柜必在你们前头过去，到约旦河里，因此你们就知道在你们中间有永生　神。</blockquote><p>书3:11<blockquote><p>See, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go into the Jordan ahead of you.<p>并且他必在你们面前赶出迦南人，赫人，希未人，比利洗人，革迦撒人，亚摩利人，耶布斯人。</blockquote><p>书3:12<blockquote><p>Now then, choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.<p>你们现在要从以色列支派中拣选十二个人，每支派一人，</blockquote><p>书3:13<blockquote><p>And as soon as the priests who carry the ark of the LORD–the Lord of all the earth–set foot in the Jordan, its waters flowing downstream will be cut off and stand up in a heap.”<p>等到抬普天下主耶和华约柜的祭司把脚站在约旦河水里，约旦河的水，就是从上往下流的水，必然断绝，立起成垒。”</blockquote><p>书3:14<blockquote><p>So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them.<p>百姓离开帐棚，要过约旦河的时候，抬约柜的祭司乃在百姓的前头。</blockquote><p>书3:15<blockquote><p>Now the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest.

You did not do it with your own sword and bow.<p>我打发黄蜂飞在你们前面，将亚摩利人的二王从你们面前撵出，并不是用你的刀，也不是用你的弓。</blockquote><p>书24:13<blockquote><p>So I gave you a land on which you did not toil and cities you did not build; and you live in them and eat from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.’<p>我赐给你们地土，非你们所修治的；我赐给你们城邑，非你们所建造的。你们就住在其中，又得吃非你们所栽种的葡萄园、橄榄园的果子。’</blockquote><p>书24:14<blockquote><p>“Now fear the LORD and serve him with all faithfulness. Throw away the gods your forefathers worshiped beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD.<p>现在你们要敬畏耶和华，诚心实意地事奉他，将你们列祖在大河那边和在埃及所事奉的　神除掉，去事奉耶和华。</blockquote><p>书24:15<blockquote><p>But if serving the LORD seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your forefathers served beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living. But as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD.”<p>若是你们以事奉耶和华为不好，今日就可以选择所要事奉的：是你们列祖在大河那边所事奉的　神呢？是你们所住这地的亚摩利人的　神呢？至于我和我家，我们必定事奉耶和华。”</blockquote><p>书24:16<blockquote><p>Then the people answered, “Far be it from us to forsake the LORD to serve other gods!<p>百姓回答说：“我们断不敢离弃耶和华去事奉别　神，</blockquote><p>书24:17<blockquote><p>It was the LORD our God himself who brought us and our fathers up out of Egypt, from that land of slavery, and performed those great signs before our eyes.

We too will serve the LORD, because he is our God.”<p>耶和华又把住此地的亚摩利人都从我们面前赶出去。所以，我们必事奉耶和华，因为他是我们的　神。”</blockquote><p>书24:19<blockquote><p>Joshua said to the people, “You are not able to serve the LORD. He is a holy God; he is a jealous God. He will not forgive your rebellion and your sins.<p>约书亚对百姓说：“你们不能事奉耶和华，因为他是圣洁的　神，是忌邪的　神，必不赦免你们的过犯罪恶。</blockquote><p>书24:20<blockquote><p>If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, he will turn and bring disaster on you and make an end of you, after he has been good to you.”<p>你们若离弃耶和华去事奉外邦　神，耶和华在降福之后，必转而降祸与你们，把你们灭绝。”</blockquote><p>书24:21<blockquote><p>But the people said to Joshua, “No!

It has heard all the words the LORD has said to us. It will be a witness against you if you are untrue to your God.”<p>约书亚对百姓说：“看哪！这石头可以向我们作见证，因为是听见了耶和华所吩咐我们的一切话，倘或你们背弃你们的　神，这石头就可以向你们作见证（“倘或云云”或作“所以要向你们作见证，免得你们背弃耶和华你们的　神”）。”</blockquote><p>书24:28<blockquote><p>Then Joshua sent the people away, each to his own inheritance.<p>于是约书亚打发百姓各归自己的地业去了。</blockquote><p>书24:29<blockquote><p>After these things, Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of a hundred and ten.<p>这些事以后，耶和华的仆人嫩的儿子约书亚，正一百一十岁就死了。</blockquote><p>书24:30<blockquote><p>And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.<p>以色列人将他葬在他地业的境内，就是在以法莲山地的亭拿西拉，在迦实山的北边。</blockquote><p>书24:31<blockquote><p>Israel served the LORD throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had experienced everything the LORD had done for Israel.<p>约书亚在世和约书亚死后，那些知道耶和华为以色列人所行诸事的长老还在的时候，以色列人事奉耶和华。</blockquote><p>书24:32<blockquote><p>And Joseph’s bones, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the tract of land that Jacob bought for a hundred pieces of silver from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem. This became the inheritance of Joseph’s descendants.<p>以色列人从埃及所带来约瑟的骸骨，葬埋在示剑，就是在雅各从前用一百块银子向示剑的父亲哈抹的子孙所买的那块地里，这就作了约瑟子孙的产业。</blockquote><p>书24:33<blockquote><p>And Eleazar son of Aaron died and was buried at Gibeah, which had been allotted to his son Phinehas in the hill country of Ephraim.<p>亚伦的儿子以利亚撒也死了，就把他葬在他儿子非尼哈以法莲山地所得的小山上。</blockquote></article><footer role="contentinfo"><hr/><p><small class="copyright">© Seon Zhu 2022.
