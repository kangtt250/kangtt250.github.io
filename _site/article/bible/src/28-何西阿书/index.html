Then the LORD said to Hosea, “Call her Lo-Ruhamah, for I will no longer show love to the house of Israel, that I should at all forgive them.<p>歌篾又怀孕生了一个女儿，耶和华对何西阿说：“给她起名叫罗路哈玛（就是“不蒙怜悯”的意思）；因为我必不再怜悯以色列家，决不赦免他们。</blockquote><p>何1:7<blockquote><p>Yet I will show love to the house of Judah; and I will save them–not by bow, sword or battle, or by horses and horsemen, but by the LORD their God.”<p>我却要怜悯犹大家，使他们靠耶和华他们的　神得救，不使他们靠弓、刀、争战、马匹与马兵得救。”</blockquote><p>何1:8<blockquote><p>After she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, Gomer had another son.<p>歌篾给罗路哈玛断奶以后，又怀孕生了一个儿子。</blockquote><p>何1:9<blockquote><p>Then the LORD said, “Call him Lo-Ammi, for you are not my people, and I am not your God.<p>耶和华说：“给他起名叫罗阿米（就是“非我民”的意思）；因为你们不作我的子民，我也不作你们的　神。</blockquote><p>何1:10<blockquote><p>“Yet the Israelites will be like the sand on the seashore, which cannot be measured or counted.

She said, ‘I will go after my lovers, who give me my food and my water, my wool and my linen, my oil and my drink.’<p>他们的母亲行了淫乱，怀他们的母做了可羞耻的事，因为她说：‘我要随从所爱的，我的饼、水、羊毛、麻、油、酒都是他们给的。’</blockquote><p>何2:6<blockquote><p>Therefore I will block her path with thornbushes; I will wall her in so that she cannot find her way.<p>因此，我必用荆棘堵塞她的道，筑墙挡住她，使她找不着路。</blockquote><p>何2:7<blockquote><p>She will chase after her lovers but not catch them; she will look for them but not find them. Then she will say, ‘I will go back to my husband as at first, for then I was better off than now.’<p>她必追随所爱的，却追不上；她必寻找他们，却寻不见。便说：‘我要归回前夫，因我那时的光景比如今还好。’</blockquote><p>何2:8<blockquote><p>She has not acknowledged that I was the one who gave her the grain, the new wine and oil, who lavished on her the silver and gold–which they used for Baal.<p>她不知道是我给她五谷、新酒和油，又加增她的金银，她却以此供奉（或作“制造”）巴力。</blockquote><p>何2:9<blockquote><p>“Therefore I will take away my grain when it ripens, and my new wine when it is ready.

There she will sing as in the days of her youth, as in the day she came up out of Egypt.<p>她从那里出来，我必赐她葡萄园，又赐她亚割谷作为指望的门。她必在那里应声（或作“歌唱”），与幼年的日子一样，与从埃及地上来的时候相同。”</blockquote><p>何2:16<blockquote><p>“In that day,” declares the LORD, “you will call me ‘my husband’; you will no longer call me ‘my master.’<p>耶和华说：“那日你必称呼我伊施（就是“我夫”的意思），不再称呼我巴力（就是“我主”的意思）。</blockquote><p>何2:17<blockquote><p>I will remove the names of the Baals from her lips; no longer will their names be invoked.<p>因为我必从我民的口中除掉诸巴力的名号，这名号不再提起。</blockquote><p>何2:18<blockquote><p>In that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the creatures that move along the ground. Bow and sword and battle I will abolish from the land, so that all may lie down in safety.<p>当那日，我必为我的民与田野的走兽和空中的飞鸟，并地上的昆虫立约。又必在国中折断弓刀，止息争战，使他们安然躺卧。</blockquote><p>何2:19<blockquote><p>I will betroth you to me forever; I will betroth you in righteousness and justice, in love and compassion.<p>我必聘你永远归我为妻，以仁义、公平、慈爱、怜悯聘你归我，</blockquote><p>何2:20<blockquote><p>I will betroth you in faithfulness, and you will acknowledge the LORD.<p>也以诚实聘你归我，你就必认识我耶和华。”</blockquote><p>何2:21<blockquote><p>“In that day I will respond,” declares the LORD–“I will respond to the skies, and they will respond to the earth;<p>耶和华说：“那日我必应允，我必应允天，天必应允地；</blockquote><p>何2:22<blockquote><p>and the earth will respond to the grain, the new wine and oil, and they will respond to Jezreel.<p>地必应允五谷、新酒和油，这些必应允耶斯列民（“耶斯列”就是“　神栽种的”意思）。</blockquote><p>何2:23<blockquote><p>I will plant her for myself in the land; I will show my love to the one I called ‘Not my loved one.’ I will say to those called ‘Not my people,’ ‘You are my people’; and they will say, ‘You are my God.’”<p>我必将他种在这地。素不蒙怜悯的，我必怜悯；本非我民的，我必对他说：‘你是我的民。’他必说：‘你是我的　神。’”</blockquote><h2 id="何西阿书第3章">何西阿书第3章</h2><p>何3:1<blockquote><p>The LORD said to me, “Go, show your love to your wife again, though she is loved by another and is an adulteress. Love her as the LORD loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes.”<p>耶和华对我说：“你再去爱一个淫妇，就是她情人所爱的；好像以色列人，虽然偏向别　神，喜爱葡萄饼，耶和华还是爱他们。”</blockquote><p>何3:2<blockquote><p>So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and about a homer and a lethek of barley.<p>我便用银子十五舍客勒，大麦一贺梅珥半，买她归我。</blockquote><p>何3:3<blockquote><p>Then I told her, “You are to live with me many days; you must not be a prostitute or be intimate with any man, and I will live with you.”<p>我对她说：“你当多日为我独居，不可行淫，不可归别人为妻，我向你也必这样。”</blockquote><p>何3:4<blockquote><p>For the Israelites will live many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred stones, without ephod or idol.<p>以色列人也必多日独居，无君王、无首领、无祭祀、无柱像、无以弗得、无家中的神像。</blockquote><p>何3:5<blockquote><p>Afterward the Israelites will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king. They will come trembling to the LORD and to his blessings in the last days.<p>后来以色列人必归回（或作“回心转意”），寻求他们的　神耶和华和他们的王大卫。在末后的日子，必以敬畏的心归向耶和华，领受他的恩惠。</blockquote><h2 id="何西阿书第4章">何西阿书第4章</h2><p>何4:1<blockquote><p>Hear the word of the LORD, you Israelites, because the LORD has a charge to bring against you who live in the land: “There is no faithfulness, no love, no acknowledgment of God in the land.<p>“以色列人哪，你们当听耶和华的话。耶和华与这地的居民争辩，因这地上无诚实，无良善，无人认识　神。</blockquote><p>何4:2<blockquote><p>There is only cursing, lying and murder, stealing and adultery; they break all bounds, and bloodshed follows bloodshed.<p>但起假誓、不践前言、杀害、偷盗、奸淫、行强暴、杀人流血，接连不断。</blockquote><p>何4:3<blockquote><p>Because of this the land mourns, and all who live in it waste away; the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the fish of the sea are dying.<p>因此，这地悲哀，其上的民、田野的兽、空中的鸟必都衰微，海中的鱼也必消灭。</blockquote><p>何4:4<blockquote><p>“But let no man bring a charge, let no man accuse another, for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest.<p>然而，人都不必争辩，也不必指责，因为这民与抗拒祭司的人一样。</blockquote><p>何4:5<blockquote><p>You stumble day and night, and the prophets stumble with you. So I will destroy your mother–<p>你这祭司必日间跌倒；先知也必夜间与你一同跌倒。我必灭绝你的母亲。</blockquote><p>何4:6<blockquote><p>my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge. “Because you have rejected knowledge, I also reject you as my priests; because you have ignored the law of your God, I also will ignore your children.<p>我的民因无知识而灭亡。你弃掉知识，我也必弃掉你，使你不再给我作祭司；你既忘了你　神的律法，我也必忘记你的儿女。</blockquote><p>何4:7<blockquote><p>The more the priests increased, the more they sinned against me; they exchanged their Glory for something disgraceful.<p>祭司越发增多，就越发得罪我；我必使他们的荣耀变为羞辱。</blockquote><p>何4:8<blockquote><p>They feed on the sins of my people and relish their wickedness.<p>他们吃我民的赎罪祭，满心愿意我民犯罪。</blockquote><p>何4:9<blockquote><p>And it will be: Like people, like priests. I will punish both of them for their ways and repay them for their deeds.<p>将来民如何，祭司也必如何。我必因他们所行的惩罚他们，照他们所做的报应他们。</blockquote><p>何4:10<blockquote><p>“They will eat but not have enough; they will engage in prostitution but not increase, because they have deserted the LORD to give themselves<p>他们吃，却不得饱；行淫，而不得立后；因为他们离弃耶和华，不遵他的命。</blockquote><p>何4:11<blockquote><p>to prostitution, to old wine and new, which take away the understanding<p>奸淫和酒，并新酒，夺去人的心。</blockquote><p>何4:12<blockquote><p>of my people.

Therefore your daughters turn to prostitution and your daughters-in-law to adultery.<p>在各山顶，各高冈的橡树、杨树、栗树之下献祭烧香，因为树影美好。所以，你们的女儿淫乱，你们的新妇（或作“儿妇”。下同）行淫。</blockquote><p>何4:14<blockquote><p>“I will not punish your daughters when they turn to prostitution, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, because the men themselves consort with harlots and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes–a people without understanding will come to ruin!<p>你们的女儿淫乱，你们的新妇行淫，我却不惩罚她们，因为你们自己离群与娼妓同居，与妓女一同献祭。这无知的民必致倾倒！</blockquote><p>何4:15<blockquote><p>“Though you commit adultery, O Israel, let not Judah become guilty. “Do not go to Gilgal; do not go up to Beth Aven.
