I"p<p>With a lot of us heading to and fro, visiting friends and relatives around this time, we felt that we should take a
break from Project V for a bit. After all, a bit of R&amp;R can be vital to someone’s productivity.</p>

<p>To that end, we’ll be taking this week and the next off. The next blog post’ll be for the 9th of August!</p>

<p>‘Til next time!</p>
