- In this role, I’ve led the end-to-end delivery of several cornerstone initiatives that have materially advanced Binance’s institutional and retail derivatives capabilities:
 • Futures Low Latency Service: Purpose-built for institutional and HFT clients, this infrastructure upgrade significantly reduced order execution latency and now facilitates over 80% of the platform’s total futures trading volume.
 • USDC-Margined Contracts: Introduced to meet the increasing demand for stablecoin-settled instruments, enhancing capital efficiency and broadening our appeal to both retail and institutional users.
 • Options Block Trading: Developed and launched a block trade mechanism for options, enabling large-volume, customized trades for professional traders and institutions.

- These strategic initiatives have not only strengthened our competitive position but also deepened institutional penetration and improved user retention. I collaborate extensively with engineering, quant, operations, compliance, and global BD teams to ensure timely, high-quality delivery in a highly dynamic and regulated market environment.
