## 犹大书第1章
犹1:1
> Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James, To those who have been called, who are loved by God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ:
>
> 耶稣基督的仆人，雅各的弟兄犹大，写信给那被召、在父　神里蒙爱、为耶稣基督保守的人：


犹1:2
> Mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance.
>
> 愿怜恤、平安、慈爱多多地加给你们！


犹1:3
> Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt I had to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints.
>
> 亲爱的弟兄啊，我想尽心写信给你们，论我们同得救恩的时候，就不得不写信劝你们，要为从前一次交付圣徒的真道竭力地争辩。


犹1:4
> For certain men whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you. They are godless men, who change the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord.
>
> 因为有些人偷着进来，就是自古被定受刑罚的，是不虔诚的，将我们　神的恩变作放纵情欲的机会，并且不认独一的主宰我们（我们或作和我们）主耶稣基督。


犹1:5
> Though you already know all this, I want to remind you that the Lord delivered his people out of Egypt, but later destroyed those who did not believe.
>
> 从前主救了他的百姓出埃及地，后来就把那些不信的灭绝了。这一切的事你们虽然都知道，我却仍要提醒你们。


犹1:6
> And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their own home--these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day.
>
> 又有不守本位、离开自己住处的天使，主用锁链把他们永远拘留在黑暗里，等候大日的审判。


犹1:7
> In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.
>
> 又如所多玛、蛾摩拉和周围城邑的人，也照他们一味的行淫，随从逆性的情欲，就受永火的刑罚，作为鉴戒。


犹1:8
> In the very same way, these dreamers pollute their own bodies, reject authority and slander celestial beings.
>
> 这些做梦的人也像他们污秽身体，轻慢主治的，毁谤在尊位的。


犹1:9
> But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him, but said, "The Lord rebuke you!"
>
> 天使长米迦勒为摩西的尸首与魔鬼争辩的时候，尚且不敢用毁谤的话罪责他，只说：“主责备你吧！”


犹1:10
> Yet these men speak abusively against whatever they do not understand; and what things they do understand by instinct, like unreasoning animals--these are the very things that destroy them.
>
> 但这些人毁谤他们所不知道的。他们本性所知道的事与那没有灵性的畜类一样，在这事上竟败坏了自己。


犹1:11
> Woe to them! They have taken the way of Cain; they have rushed for profit into Balaam's error; they have been destroyed in Korah's rebellion.
>
> 他们有祸了！因为走了该隐的道路，又为利往巴兰的错谬里直奔，并在可拉的背叛中灭亡了。


犹1:12
> These men are blemishes at your love feasts, eating with you without the slightest qualm--shepherds who feed only themselves. They are clouds without rain, blown along by the wind; autumn trees, without fruit and uprooted--twice dead.
>
> 这样的人在你们的爱席上与你们同吃的时候，正是礁石（或作“玷污”）。他们作牧人，只知喂养自己，无所惧怕；是没有雨的云彩，被风飘荡；是秋天没有果子的树，死而又死，连根被拔出来；


犹1:13
> They are wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shame; wandering stars, for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever.
>
> 是海里的狂浪，涌出自己可耻的沫子来；是流荡的星，有墨黑的幽暗为他们永远存留。


犹1:14
> Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men: "See, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones
>
> 亚当的七世孙以诺曾预言这些人说：“看哪，主带着他的千万圣者降临，


犹1:15
> to judge everyone, and to convict all the ungodly of all the ungodly acts they have done in the ungodly way, and of all the harsh words ungodly sinners have spoken against him."
>
> 要在众人身上行审判，证实那一切不敬虔的人所妄行一切不敬虔的事，又证实不敬虔之罪人所说顶撞他的刚愎话。”


犹1:16
> These men are grumblers and faultfinders; they follow their own evil desires; they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.
>
> 这些人是私下议论，常发怨言的，随从自己的情欲而行，口中说夸大的话，为得便宜谄媚人。


犹1:17
> But, dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold.
>
> 亲爱的弟兄啊，你们要记念我们主耶稣基督之使徒从前所说的话。


犹1:18
> They said to you, "In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires."
>
> 他们曾对你们说过，末世必有好讥诮的人随从自己不敬虔的私欲而行。


犹1:19
> These are the men who divide you, who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the Spirit.
>
> 这就是那些引人结党，属乎血气，没有圣灵的人。


犹1:20
> But you, dear friends, build yourselves up in your most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit.
>
> 亲爱的弟兄啊，你们却要在至圣的真道上造就自己，在圣灵里祷告，


犹1:21
> Keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life.
>
> 保守自己常在　神的爱中，仰望我们主耶稣基督的怜悯，直到永生。


犹1:22
> Be merciful to those who doubt;
>
> 有些人存疑心，你们要怜悯他们；


犹1:23
> snatch others from the fire and save them; to others show mercy, mixed with fear--hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.
>
> 有些人你们要从火中抢出来，搭救他们；有些人你们要存惧怕的心怜悯他们，连那被情欲沾染的衣服也当厌恶。


犹1:24
> To him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy--
>
> 那能保守你们不失脚、叫你们无瑕无疵、欢欢喜喜站在他荣耀之前的我们的救主独一的　神


犹1:25
> to the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore! Amen.
>
> 愿荣耀、威严、能力、权柄，因我们的主耶稣基督归与他，从万古以前，并现今，直到永永远远。阿们。
