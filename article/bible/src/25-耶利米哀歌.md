## 耶利米哀歌第1章
哀1:1
> How deserted lies the city, once so full of people! How like a widow is she, who once was great among the nations! She who was queen among the provinces has now become a slave.
>
> 先前满有人民的城，现在何竟独坐！先前在列国中为大的，现在竟如寡妇！先前在诸省中为王后的，现在成为进贡的。


哀1:2
> Bitterly she weeps at night, tears are upon her cheeks. Among all her lovers there is none to comfort her. All her friends have betrayed her; they have become her enemies.
>
> 她夜间痛哭，泪流满腮；在一切所亲爱的中间没有一个安慰她的。她的朋友都以诡诈待她，成为她的仇敌。


哀1:3
> After affliction and harsh labor, Judah has gone into exile. She dwells among the nations; she finds no resting place. All who pursue her have overtaken her in the midst of her distress.
>
> 犹大因遭遇苦难，又因多服劳苦，就迁到外邦。她住在列国中，寻不着安息；追逼她的，都在狭窄之地将她追上。


哀1:4
> The roads to Zion mourn, for no one comes to her appointed feasts. All her gateways are desolate, her priests groan, her maidens grieve, and she is in bitter anguish.
>
> 锡安的路径，因无人来守圣节就悲伤。她的城门凄凉，她的祭司叹息，她的处女受艰难，自己也愁苦。

>
> 耶路撒冷在困苦窘迫之时，就追想古时一切的乐境。她百姓落在敌人手中，无人救济，敌人看见，就因她的荒凉嗤笑。


哀1:8
> Jerusalem has sinned greatly and so has become unclean. All who honored her despise her, for they have seen her nakedness; she herself groans and turns away.
>
> 耶路撒冷大大犯罪，所以成为不洁之物，素来尊敬她的，见她赤露就都藐视她；她自己也叹息退后。


哀1:9
> Her filthiness clung to her skirts; she did not consider her future. Her fall was astounding; there was none to comfort her. "Look, O LORD, on my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed."
>
> 她的污秽是在衣襟上。她不思想自己的结局，所以非常的败落，无人安慰她。她说：“耶和华啊，求你看我的苦难，因为仇敌夸大。”


哀1:10
> The enemy laid hands on all her treasures; she saw pagan nations enter her sanctuary--those you had forbidden to enter your assembly.
>
> 敌人伸手夺取她的美物。她眼见外邦人进入她的圣所；论这外邦人，你曾吩咐不可入你的会中。


哀1:11
> All her people groan as they search for bread; they barter their treasures for food to keep themselves alive. "Look, O LORD, and consider, for I am despised."
>
> 她的民都叹息，寻求食物；他们用美物换粮食，要救性命。他们说：“耶和华啊，求你观看，因为我甚是卑贱。

> "From on high he sent fire, sent it down into my bones. He spread a net for my feet and turned me back. He made me desolate, faint all the day long.
>
> 他从高天使火进入我的骨头，克制了我；他铺下网罗，绊我的脚，使我转回，他使我终日凄凉发昏。


哀1:14
> "My sins have been bound into a yoke; by his hands they were woven together. They have come upon my neck and the Lord has sapped my strength. He has handed me over to those I cannot withstand.
>
> 我罪过的轭是他手所绑的，犹如轭绳缚在我颈项上，他使我的力量衰败。主将我交在我所不能敌挡的人手中。


哀1:15

>
> 主轻弃我中间的一切勇士，招聚多人（原文作“大会”）攻击我，要压碎我的少年人。主将犹大居民踹下，像在酒榨中一样。


哀1:16

>
> 我因这些事哭泣，我眼泪汪汪，因为那当安慰我、救我性命的，离我甚远。我的儿女孤苦，因为仇敌得了胜。”


哀1:17
> Zion stretches out her hands, but there is no one to comfort her. The LORD has decreed for Jacob that his neighbors become his foes; Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them.
>
> 锡安举手，无人安慰。耶和华论雅各已经出令，使四围的人作她仇敌，耶路撒冷在他们中间像不洁之物。


哀1:18

哀1:19
> "I called to my allies but they betrayed me. My priests and my elders perished in the city while they searched for food to keep themselves alive.
>
> 我招呼我所亲爱的，他们却愚弄我。我的祭司和长老正寻求食物救性命的时候，就在城中绝气。


哀1:20
> "See, O LORD, how distressed I am! I am in torment within, and in my heart I am disturbed, for I have been most rebellious. Outside, the sword bereaves; inside, there is only death.
>
> 耶和华啊，求你观看，因为我在急难中！我心肠扰乱，我心在我里面翻转，因我大大悖逆。在外刀剑使人丧子；在家犹如死亡。


哀1:21
> "People have heard my groaning, but there is no one to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my distress; they rejoice at what you have done. May you bring the day you have announced so they may become like me.
>
> 听见我叹息的有人；安慰我的却无人！我的仇敌都听见我所遭的患难；因你做这事，他们都喜乐。你必使你报告的日子来到，他们就像我一样。


哀1:22
> "Let all their wickedness come before you; deal with them as you have dealt with me because of all my sins. My groans are many and my heart is faint."
>
> 愿他们的恶行都呈在你面前；你怎样因我的一切罪过待我，求你照样待他们，因我叹息甚多，心中发昏。”


## 耶利米哀歌第2章

>
> 主何竟发怒，使黑云遮蔽锡安城？他将以色列的华美从天扔在地上；在他发怒的日子并不记念自己的脚凳。

>
> 主吞灭雅各一切的住处，并不顾惜。他发怒倾覆犹大民的保障，使这保障坍倒在地。他辱没这国和其中的首领。


哀2:3
> In fierce anger he has cut off every horn of Israel. He has withdrawn his right hand at the approach of the enemy. He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire that consumes everything around it.
>
> 他发烈怒，把以色列的角全然砍断，在仇敌面前收回右手。他像火焰四围吞灭，将雅各烧毁。


哀2:4
> Like an enemy he has strung his bow; his right hand is ready. Like a foe he has slain all who were pleasing to the eye; he has poured out his wrath like fire on the tent of the Daughter of Zion.
>
> 他张弓，好像仇敌；他站着举起右手，如同敌人将悦人眼目的，尽行杀戮。在锡安百姓的帐棚上，倒出他的忿怒像火一样。


哀2:5
> The Lord is like an enemy; he has swallowed up Israel. He has swallowed up all her palaces and destroyed her strongholds. He has multiplied mourning and lamentation for the Daughter of Judah.
>
> 主如仇敌吞灭以色列和锡安的一切宫殿，拆毁百姓的保障；在犹大民中，加增悲伤哭号。


哀2:6
> He has laid waste his dwelling like a garden; he has destroyed his place of meeting. The LORD has made Zion forget her appointed feasts and her Sabbaths; in his fierce anger he has spurned both king and priest.
>
> 他强取自己的帐幕，好像是园中的窝棚，毁坏他的聚会之处。耶和华使圣节和安息日在锡安都被忘记，又在怒气的愤恨中藐视君王和祭司。

>
> 耶和华丢弃自己的祭坛，憎恶自己的圣所，将宫殿的墙垣交付仇敌。他们在耶和华的殿中喧嚷，像在圣会之日一样。

> The LORD determined to tear down the wall around the Daughter of Zion. He stretched out a measuring line and did not withhold his hand from destroying. He made ramparts and walls lament; together they wasted away.
>
> 耶和华定意拆毁锡安的城墙；他拉了准绳，不将手收回，定要毁灭。他使外郭和城墙都悲哀，一同衰败。

> 耶路撒冷的民哪，我可用什么向你证明呢？我可用什么与你相比呢？锡安的民哪，我可拿什么和你比较，好安慰你呢？因为你的裂口大如海，谁能医治你呢？


哀2:14
> The visions of your prophets were false and worthless; they did not expose your sin to ward off your captivity. The oracles they gave you were false and misleading.
>
> 你的先知为你见虚假和愚昧的异象，并没有显露你的罪孽，使你被掳的归回，却为你见虚假的默示和使你被赶出本境的缘故。


哀2:15
> All who pass your way clap their hands at you; they scoff and shake their heads at the Daughter of Jerusalem: "Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?"
>
> 凡过路的都向你拍掌。他们向耶路撒冷城嗤笑、摇头，说：“难道人所称为全美的，称为全地所喜悦的，就是这城吗？”


哀2:16
> All your enemies open their mouths wide against you; they scoff and gnash their teeth and say, "We have swallowed her up. This is the day we have waited for; we have lived to see it."

>
> 锡安民的心哀求主。锡安的城墙啊，愿你流泪如河，昼夜不息；愿你眼中的瞳人泪流不止。


哀2:19
> Arise, cry out in the night, as the watches of the night begin; pour out your heart like water in the presence of the Lord. Lift up your hands to him for the lives of your children, who faint from hunger at the head of every street.
>
> 夜间，每逢交更的时候要起来呼喊，在主面前倾心如水。你的孩童在各市口上受饿发昏，你要为他们的性命向主举手祷告。


哀2:20
> "Look, O LORD, and consider: Whom have you ever treated like this? Should women eat their offspring, the children they have cared for? Should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?
>
> “耶和华啊，求你观看！见你向谁这样行？妇人岂可吃自己所生育、手里所摇弄的婴孩吗？祭司和先知岂可在主的圣所中被杀戮吗？


哀2:21
> "Young and old lie together in the dust of the streets; my young men and maidens have fallen by the sword. You have slain them in the day of your anger; you have slaughtered them without pity.
>
> 少年人和老年人都在街上躺卧；我的处女和壮丁都倒在刀下。你发怒的日子杀死他们。你杀了，并不顾惜。

>
> 你招聚四围惊吓我的，像在大会的日子招聚人一样。耶和华发怒的日子，无人逃脱，无人存留。我所摇弄所养育的婴孩，仇敌都杀净了。”
