# Prioritize and Focus

确定优先顺序和重点

I’ve encountered plenty of bad luck along the way. The first little fortune I made I instantly lost in the stock market. The second little fortune I made, or should have made, I basically got cheated out of by my business partners. It’s only the third time around that has been a charm.

我一路上遇到了很多厄运。我赚到的第一笔小财富马上就输在了股票市场上。我赚的或者应该赚的第二小笔钱，基本上被我的商业伙伴骗走了。这已经是第三次了，这是一种魅力。

Even then, it has been a slow and steady struggle. I haven’t made money in my life in one giant payout. It has always been a whole bunch of small things piling up. It’s more about consistently creating wealth by creating businesses, creating opportunities, and creating investments. It hasn’t been a giant one -off thing. My personal wealth has not been generated by one big year. It just stacks up a little bit, a few chips at a time: more options, more businesses, more investments, more things I can do.

即便如此，这也是一场缓慢而稳定的斗争。我这辈子还没有在一次巨额支出中赚过钱。它总是一大堆小东西堆积在一起。它更多的是通过创造商业、创造机会和创造投资来持续创造财富。这并不是一件巨大的一次性的事情。我的个人财富不是靠一个大年份创造出来的。它只是堆积了一点，一次几个芯片：更多的选择，更多的业务，更多的投资，更多的事情我可以做。

Thanks to the internet, opportunities are massively abundant. In fact, I have too many ways to make money. I don’t have enough time. I literally have opportunities pouring out of my ears, and I keep running out of time. There are so many ways to create wealth, to create products, to create businesses, and to get paid by society as a byproduct. I just can’t handle them all. [78]
多亏了互联网，机会非常丰富。事实上，我有太多赚钱的方法。我没有足够的时间。我真的有大量的机会从我的耳朵里涌出，而我一直在耗尽时间。有很多方法可以创造财富，创造产品，创造企业，并作为副产品获得社会的报酬。我就是处理不了所有的问题。

Value your time at an hourly rate, and ruthlessly spend to save time at that rate. You will never be worth more than you think you’re worth.

以小时计价珍惜你的时间，并毫不留情地花在这个速度上来节省时间。你的价值永远不会超过你认为自己的价值。

No one is going to value you more than you value yourself. You just have to set a very high personal hourly rate and you have to stick to it. Even when I was young, I just decided I was worth a lot more than the market thought I was worth, and I started treating myself that way.

没有人会比你更看重你自己。你只需要设定一个非常高的个人时薪，而且你必须坚持下去。甚至在我年轻的时候，我就认为我的价值比市场认为的要高得多，我开始这样对待自己。

Always factor your time into every decision. How much time does it take? It’s going to take you an hour to get across town to get something. If you value yourself at one hundred dollars an hour, that’s basically throwing one hundred dollars out of your pocket. Are you going to do that? [78]

每一个决定都要考虑到你的时间因素。需要多长时间？你要花一个小时穿过镇子去买点东西。如果你对自己的估值是每小时100美元，那基本上就是从你的口袋里掏出100美元。你要做那件事吗？[78]

Fast -forward to your wealthy self and pick some intermediate hourly rate. For me, believe it or not, back when you could have hired me…Which now obviously you can’t, but back when you could have hired me…this was true a decade ago or even two decades ago, before I had any real money. My hourly rate, I used to say to myself over and over, is $5,000 an hour. Today when I look back, really it was about $1,000 an hour.

快进到你富有的自己，选择一些中间的时薪。对我来说，信不信由你，回到你可以雇我的时候，…现在很明显你不能，但是回到你可以雇我的时候，…十年前，甚至二十年前，在我还没有真正的钱之前，这是真的。我过去一遍又一遍地对自己说，我的时薪是每小时5000美元。今天当我回头看的时候，真的是每小时1000美元左右。

Of course, I still ended up doing stupid things like arguing with the electrician or returning the broken speaker, but I shouldn’t have, and I did a lot less than any of my friends would. I would make a theatrical show out of throwing something in the trash pile or giving it to Salvation Army rather than trying to return it or handing something to people rather than trying to fix it.

当然，我最终还是做了一些愚蠢的事情，比如和电工吵架，或者把坏掉的扬声器退回，但我不应该这样做，而且我做的事情比我的任何朋友都要少得多。我会把一些东西扔进垃圾堆，或者把它送给救世军，而不是试图把它归还，或者把东西递给人们，而不是试图修复它，这是一场戏剧表演。

I would argue with my girlfriends, and even today it’s my wife, “I don’t do that. That’s not a problem that I solve.” I still argue that with my mother when she hands me little to -do ’s. I just don’t do that. I would rather hire you an assistant. This was true even when I didn’t have money. [78]

我会和我的女朋友争执，即使在今天也是我的妻子，“我不会那样做。这不是我能解决的问题。“当我母亲给我一些待办事项时，我仍然会和她争论这一点。我只是不会那么做。我宁愿给你雇个助理。即使在我没有钱的时候，这也是真的。“[78]

Another way of thinking about something is, if you can outsource something or not do something for less than your hourly rate, outsource it or don’t do it. If you can hire someone to do it for less than your hourly rate, hire them. That even includes things like cooking. You may want to eat your healthy home cooked meals, but if you can outsource it, do that instead. [78]

思考某事的另一种方式是，如果你能以低于时薪的价格外包某事或不做某事，那就外包或不做。如果你可以雇佣比你的时薪更低的人来做这件事，那就雇佣他们吧。这甚至包括像做饭这样的事情。你可能想吃健康的家常菜，但如果你能外包，那就这么做吧。

Set a very high hourly aspirational rate for yourself and stick to it. It should seem and feel absurdly high. If it doesn’t, it’s not high enough. Whatever you picked, my advice to you would be to raise it. Like I said, for myself, even before I had money, for the longest time I used $5,000 an hour. And if you extrapolate that out into what it looks like as an annual salary, it’s multiple millions of dollars per year.

为自己设定一个非常高的每小时渴望速率，并坚持下去。它应该看起来和感觉上高得离谱。如果不是，那就是不够高。不管你选什么，我给你的建议是提高它。就像我说的，对我自己来说，甚至在我还没有钱之前，我就用了每小时5000美元，这是最长的一次。如果你把它外推到看起来像是年薪的地方，那就是每年几百万美元。

Ironically, I actually think I’ve beaten it. I’m not the hardest working person—I’m actually a lazy person. I work through bursts of energy where I’m really motivated with something. If I actually look at how much I’ve earned per actual hour that I’ve put in, it’s probably quite a bit higher than that. [78]

具有讽刺意味的是，我真的认为我打败了它。我不是最勤奋的人--我实际上是个懒人。我在精力迸发的情况下工作，在那里我真的是有动力的。如果我真的看看我每实际投入一小时赚了多少钱，可能会比这个数字高出很多。“[78]

Can you expand on your statement, “If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you”?

你能再详述一下你的说法吗？“如果你暗地里鄙视财富，它就会躲避你”。

If you get into a relative mindset, you’re always going to hate people who do better than you, you’re always going to be jealous or envious of them. They’ll sense those feelings when you try and do business with them. When you try and do business with somebody, if you have any bad thoughts or any judgments about them, they will feel it. Humans are wired to feel what the other person deep down inside feels. You have to get out of a relative mindset. [10]

如果你进入一种相对的心态，你总是会憎恨比你做得更好的人，你总是会嫉妒或羡慕他们。当你试着和他们做生意时，他们会感觉到这种感觉。当你试图与某人做生意时，如果你对他们有任何不好的想法或判断，他们会感觉到的。人类与生俱来就能感受到他人内心深处的感受。你必须走出相对的思维定势。

Literally, being anti -wealth will prevent you from becoming wealthy, because you will not have the right mindset for it, you won’t have the right spirit, and you won’t be dealing with people on the right level. Be optimistic, be positive. It’s important. Optimists actually do better in the long run. [10]

从字面上看，反财富会阻止你变得富有，因为你不会有正确的心态，你不会有正确的精神，你也不会在正确的层面上与人打交道。要乐观，要积极。这很重要。从长远来看，乐观主义者实际上做得更好。

The business world has many people playing zero sum games and a few playing positive sum games searching for each other in the crowd.

商界有很多人玩零和游戏，少数人玩正和游戏，在人群中互相寻找。

There are fundamentally two huge games in life that people play. One is the money game. Because money is not going to solve all of your problems, but it’s going to solve all of your money problems. People realize that, so they want to make money.

从根本上说，人们生活中有两个巨大的游戏可玩。一个是金钱游戏。因为钱不会解决你所有的问题，但它会解决你所有的钱问题。人们意识到了这一点，所以他们想赚钱。

But at the same time, many of them, deep down, believe they can’t make money. They don’t want any wealth creation to happen. So, they attack the whole enterprise by saying, “Well, making money is evil. You shouldn’t do it.”

但与此同时，他们中的许多人在内心深处认为自己赚不到钱。他们不希望任何财富创造发生。因此，他们攻击整个企业说，“嗯，赚钱是邪恶的。你不应该这么做。“

But they’re actually playing the other game, which is the status game. They’re trying to be high status in the eyes of other people watching by saying, “Well, I don’t need money. We don’t want money.” Status is your ranking in the social hierarchy. [78]

但他们实际上在玩另一个游戏，那就是状态游戏。他们试图通过说“嗯，我不需要钱”来在其他人的眼里保持较高的地位。我们不要钱。“地位是你在社会等级中的排名。

Wealth creation is an evolutionarily recent positive -sum game. Status is an old zero -sum game. Those attacking wealth creation are often just seeking status.

财富创造是一种进化上最近的正和游戏。地位是一个古老的零和游戏。那些攻击财富创造的人往往只是为了寻求地位。

Status is a zero -sum game. It’s a very old game. We’ve been playing it since monkey tribes. It’s hierarchical. Who’s number one? Who’s number two? Who’s number three? And for number three to move to number two, number two has to move out of that slot. So, status is a zero -sum game.

地位是一个零和游戏。这是一个非常古老的游戏。我们从猴子部落就开始玩了。这是分等级的。谁是第一名？谁是第二名？谁是三号？为了让三号移动到二号，二号必须移出那个位置。所以，地位是一个零和游戏。

Politics is an example of a status game. Even sports are an example of a status game. To be the winner, there must be a loser. I don’t fundamentally love status games. They play an important role in our society, so we can figure out who’s in charge. But fundamentally, you play them because they’re a necessary evil. [78]

政治是地位游戏的一个例子。即使是体育运动也是地位游戏的一个例子。要想成为赢家，就必须有失败者。我根本不喜欢状态游戏。他们在我们的社会中扮演着重要的角色，所以我们可以弄清楚谁是负责人。但从根本上说，你玩弄它们是因为它们是一种必要的邪恶。

The problem is, to win at a status game, you have to put somebody else down. That’s why you should avoid status games in your life—they make you into an angry, combative person. You’re always fighting to put other people down, to put yourself and the people you like up.

问题是，要想在状态游戏中取胜，你必须击倒别人。这就是为什么你应该避免在你的生活中玩状态游戏--它们会让你变成一个愤怒、好斗的人。你总是努力贬低别人，贬低你自己和你喜欢的人。

Status games are always going to exist. There’s no way around it, but realize most of the time, when you’re trying to create wealth and you’re getting attacked by someone else, they’re trying to increase their own status at your expense. They’re playing a different game. And it’s a worse game. It’s a zero -sum game instead of a positive -sum game. [78]

地位游戏总是会存在的。这是别无选择的，但你要意识到，大多数时候，当你试图创造财富，而你却受到别人的攻击时，他们是在试图以牺牲你为代价来提高自己的地位。他们在玩不同的游戏。这是一场更糟糕的比赛。这是一个零和游戏，而不是正和游戏。

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

玩愚蠢的游戏，赢得愚蠢的奖品。

What is the most important thing to do for younger people starting out?
对于开始创业的年轻人来说，最重要的事情是什么？
Spend more time making the big decisions. There are basically three really big decisions you make in your early life: where you live, who you’re with, and what you do.

花更多的时间做重大决定。在你的早期生活中，基本上有三个真正重大的决定：你住在哪里，你和谁在一起，以及你做什么。

We spend very little time deciding which relationship to get into. We spend so much time in a job, but we spend so little time deciding which job to get into. Choosing what city to live in can almost completely determine the trajectory of your life, but we spend so little time trying to figure out what city to live in.

我们花很少的时间来决定要建立哪种关系。我们在一份工作上花费了如此多的时间，但我们花在决定从事哪一份工作上的时间却如此之少。选择住在哪个城市几乎可以完全决定你的生活轨迹，但我们花在试图弄清楚住在哪个城市上的时间太少了。

Advice to a young engineer considering moving to San Francisco: “Do you want to leave your friends behind? Or be the one left behind?”
给一位考虑搬到旧金山的年轻工程师的建议：“你想把你的朋友留在后面吗？还是那个落在后面的人？“
If you’re going to live in a city for ten years, if you’re going to be in a job for five years, if you’re in a relationship for a decade, you should be spending one to two years deciding these things. These are highly dominating decisions. Those three decisions really matter.

如果你要在一个城市生活十年，如果你要工作五年，如果你要谈一段十年的恋爱，你应该花一到两年的时间来决定这些事情。这些都是具有高度支配性的决定。这三个决定真的很重要。

You have to say no to everything and free up your time so you can solve the important problems. Those three are probably the three biggest ones. [1]

你必须对一切说不，腾出时间来解决重要的问题。这三个可能是最大的三个。

What are one or two steps you’d take to surround yourself with successful people?

要让自己周围都是成功人士，你会采取什么一两个步骤呢？

Figure out what you’re good at, and start helping other people with it. Give it away. Pay it forward. Karma works because people are consistent. On a long enough timescale, you will attract what you project. But don’t measure—your patience will run out if you count. [7]

找出你擅长什么，然后开始帮助别人。送人吧。把它发扬光大。因果报应之所以有效，是因为人们是始终如一的。在足够长的时间尺度上，你会吸引你所投射的东西。但是不要测量--如果你数一数，你的耐心就会耗尽。

An old boss once warned: “You’ll never be rich since you’re obviously smart, and someone will always offer you a job that’s just good enough.”

一位老老板曾警告说：“你永远不会变得富有，因为你显然很聪明，而且总会有人给你提供一份刚刚好的工作。”

How did you decide to start your first company?

你是如何决定创办你的第一家公司的？

I was working at this tech company called @Home Network, and I told everybody around me—my boss, coworkers, my friends, “In Silicon Valley, all of these other people are starting companies. It looks like they can do it. I’m going to start a company. I’m just here temporarily. I’m an entrepreneur.”

我在一家名为@Home Network的科技公司工作，我告诉我周围的每个人--我的老板、同事、朋友，“在硅谷，所有这些人都在创业。看起来他们能做到。我要开一家公司。我只是暂时来这里。我是一名企业家。“

…I didn’t actually mean to trick myself into it. It wasn’t a deliberate, calculated thing.

…我并不是真的想骗自己去做这件事。这不是一件经过深思熟虑、经过深思熟虑的事情。

I was just venting, talking out loud, being overly honest. But I didn’t actually start a company. This was in 1996, it was a much scarier, more difficult proposition to start a company then. Sure enough, everyone started saying “What are you still doing here? I thought you were leaving to start a company?” and “Wow, you’re still here…” I was literally embarrassed into starting my own company. [5]

我只是在发泄，大声说话，太诚实了。但实际上我并没有开公司。那是在1996年，当时创办一家公司是一个可怕得多、困难得多的提议。果然，每个人都开始说“你还在这里做什么？我还以为你要离开去开公司呢？“还有“哇，你还在这里，…”我真的很尴尬，开了自己的公司。

Yes, I know some people aren’t necessarily ready to be entrepreneurs, but long -term , where did we come up with this idea the correct logical thing to do is for everybody to work for somebody else? It is a very hierarchical model. [14]

是的，我知道有些人不一定准备好成为企业家，但从长远来看，我们是从哪里想出这个想法的正确的合乎逻辑的事情是每个人都为别人工作？这是一个等级很高的模型。“[14]
