  A short blog post on what I'll be moving on to next.

This'll be a mighty short one. Just a note on what I'll be working on for the following week or so. After tightening
up the stage background for my level, I decided to take over from Will and start working on player movement as I 
feel I can get more work done coding rather than drawing. In the meantime, Will'll be working on enemy sprites
while Adrian will code the behaviour for the enemies. Our goal for the moment is to get all our mechanics 
finished and integrated into one level for the time being.

# The Past Week

After finalising the background and moving onto movement. I first refactored Will's movement script and learned how
it worked in Will's scene. I then turned it into a prefab, added it to my scene and ensured it worked as intended
in my scene. While testing the movement I came across an issue that seems to be prevalent in Unity projects: 
There's a slight frame skip I notice every now and then when moving throughout the scene. I've looked this 
up and tried a number of fixes seen online, like disabling vsync, moving code from Update to FixedUpdate
and vice versa, etc. I still have not eliminated the issue completely. I've since added an FPS Counter
script from Unity's Standard Assets package to help me keep track of the issue.

That's all for now, I'll have more updates on the movement next week.

'Til next time!
